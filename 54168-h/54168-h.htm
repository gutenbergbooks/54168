<h2><i>PREFACE.</i></h2>

<p class="dropcap">This little book is made up from the opening
series of a considerable range of “talks,”
with which&mdash;during the past few years&mdash;I have
undertaken to entertain, and (if it might be) instruct
a bevy of friends; and the interest of a few
outsiders who have come to the hearings has induced
me to put the matter in type. I feel somewhat
awkwardly in obtruding upon the public any
such panoramic view of British writers, in these
days of specialists&mdash;when students devote half a
lifetime to the analysis of the works of a single
author, and to the proper study of a single period.</p>

<p>I have tried, however, to avoid bad mistakes and
misleading ones, and shall reckon my commentary
only so far forth good&mdash;as it may familiarize the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
average reader with the salient characteristics of
the writers brought under notice, and shall put
these writers into such a swathing of historic and
geographic enwrapments as shall keep them better
in mind.</p>

<p>When I consider the large number of books
recently issued on similar topics, and the scholarly
acuteness, and the great range belonging to so
many of them, I am not a little discomforted
at thought of my bold scurry over so wide reach
of ground. Indeed, I have the figure before me
now&mdash;as I hint an apology&mdash;of an old-time country
doctor who has ventured with his saddle-bags
and spicy nostrums into competition with a half
score of special practitioners&mdash;with their microscopy
and their <i lang="fr">granules dosimetriques</i>; but I think,
consolingly, that possibly the old-time mediciner&mdash;if
not able to cure, can at the least induce a
pleasurable slumber.</p>

<h1><i>ENGLISH LANDS, LETTERS, &amp; KINGS.</i></h1>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p class="dropcap">I have undertaken in this book a series of very
familiar and informal talks with my readers
about English literary people, and the ways in which
they worked; and also about the times in which
they lived and the places where they grew up.
We shall have, therefore, a good deal of concern
with English history; and with English geography
too&mdash;or rather topography: and I think that I have
given a very fair and honest descriptive title to the
material which I shall set before my readers, in
calling it a book about <span class="smcap">English Lands and Letters
and Kings</span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>It appears to me that American young people
have an advantage over British-born students of our
History and Literature&mdash;in the fact that the localities
consecrated by great names or events have more
illuminating power to us, who encounter them
rarely and after voyage over sea, than to the Englishman
who lives and grows up beside them.
Londoners pass Bolt Court, Fleet Street, and Dr.
Johnson’s tavern a hundred times a year with no
thought but of the chops and the Barclay’s ale to
be had there. But to the cultivated American these
localities start a charming procession, in which the
doughty old Dictionary-maker, with his staff and
long brown coat and three cornered hat, is easily
the leader.</p>

<p>For my own part, when my foot first struck the
hard-worked pavement of London Bridge, even the
old nursery sing-song came over me with the force
of a poem,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">As I was going over London Bridge</div>
<div class="verse">I found a penny and bought me a kid.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>So, too&mdash;once upon a time&mdash;on a bright May-day
along the Tweed, I was attracted by an old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
square ruin of a tower&mdash;very homely&mdash;scarcely
picturesque: I had barely curiosity enough to ask
its name. A stone-breaker on the high-road told
me it was Norham Castle; and straightway all
the dash and clash of the poem of “Marmion”<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
broke around me.</p>

<p>Now I do not think our cousins the Britishers, to
whom the loveliest ruins become humdrum, can be
half as much alive as we, to this sort of enjoyment.</p>

<p>I shall have then&mdash;as I said&mdash;a great deal to
say about the topography of England as well as
about its books and writers; and shall try to tie
together your knowledge of historic facts and literary
ones, with the yet more tangible and associated
geographic facts&mdash;so that on some golden day to
come (as golden days do come) the sight of a mere
thread of spire over tree-tops, or of a cliff on Yorkshire
shores, or of a quaint gable that might
have covered a “Tabard Tavern,” shall set all your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
historic reading on the flow again&mdash;thus extending
and brightening and giving charm to a hundred
wayside experiences of Travel.</p>

<p>One other preliminary word:&mdash;On that great
reach of ground we are to pass over&mdash;if we make
reasonable time&mdash;there must be long strides, and
skippings: we can only seize upon illustrative
types&mdash;little kindling feeders of wide-reaching
flame. It may well be that I shall ignore and pass
by lines of thought or progress very lively and
present to you; may be I shall dwell on things
already familiar; nay, it may well happen that many
readers&mdash;young and old&mdash;fresh from their books&mdash;shall
know more of matters touched on in our
rapid survey than I know myself: never mind that;
but remember,&mdash;and let me say it once for all&mdash;that
my aim is not so much to give definite instruction
as to put the reader into such ways and
starts of thought as shall make him eager to instruct
himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<h3>Early Centuries.</h3>

<p>In those dreary early centuries when England
was in the throes of its beginnings, and when the
Roman eagle&mdash;which had always led a half-stifled
life amongst British fogs, had gone back to its own
eyrie in the South&mdash;the old stock historians could
and did find little to fasten our regard&mdash;save the
eternal welter of little wars. Indeed, those who
studied fifty years ago will remember that all early
British history was excessively meagre and stiff;
some of it, I daresay, left yet in the accredited
courses of school reading; dreadfully dull&mdash;with
dates piled on dates, and battles by the page; and
other pages of battle peppered with such names
as Hengist, or Ethelred and Cerdic and Cuthwulf,
or whoever could strike hardest or cut deepest.</p>

<p>But now, thanks to modern inquiry and to such
men as Stubbs and Freeman and Wright, and the
more entertaining Green&mdash;we get new light on
those old times. We watch the ribs of that ancient
land piling in distincter shape out of the water:
we see the downs and the bluffs, and the fordable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
places in the rivers; we know now just where great
wastes of wood stood in the way of our piratical
forefathers&mdash;the Saxons, the Jutes, and the Angles;
these latter either by greater moral weight in them,
or by the accident of numbers (which is the more
probable), coming to give a name to the new country
and language which were a-making together.</p>

<p>We find that those old Romans did leave, besides
their long, straight, high-roads, and Roman villas,
and store of sepulchral vases, a germ of Roman
laws, and a little nucleus of Roman words, traceable
in the institutions and&mdash;to some slight degree&mdash;in
the language of to-day.</p>

<p>We see in the later pages of Green through
what forests the rivers ran, and can go round about
the great Roman-British towns (Roman first and
then adopted by Britons) of London<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and of York;
and that other magnificent one of Cirencester (or
Sisister as the English say <!-- no, we do not -->, with a stout defiance of
their alphabet). We can understand how and why
the fat meadows of Somersetshire should be coveted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
by marauders and fought for by Celts; and
we behold more clearly and distinctly than ever,
under the precise topography of modern investigators,
the walls of wood and hills which stayed
Saxon pursuit of those Britons who sought shelter
in Wales, Cumberland, or the Cornish peninsula.</p>

<h3>Celtic Literature.</h3>

<p>Naturally, this flight of a nation to its fastnesses
was not without clamor and lament; some of which&mdash;if
we may trust current Cymric traditions&mdash;was
put into such piercing sound as has come down
to our own day in the shape of Welsh war-songs.
Dates are uncertain; but without doubt somewhat
of this Celtic shrill singing was of earlier utterance
than anything of equal literary quality that came
from our wrangling Saxon or West-Saxon forefathers
in the fertile plains of England.</p>

<p>Some of these Celtic war strains have been turned
into a music by the poet Gray<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> which our English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
ears love; Emerson used to find regalement in the
strains of another Welsh bard; and the Mabinogion,
a pleasant budget of old Cymric fable,<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> has
come to a sort of literary resurrection in our day
under the hands of the late Sidney Lanier. If you
would know more of things Celtic, I would commend
to your attention a few lectures read at Oxford
in 1864-65 by Matthew Arnold in which he
has brought a curious zeal, and his wonted acumen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
to an investigation of the influences upon English
literature of that old Celtic current. It was a wild,
turbulent current; it had fret and roar in it; it
had passion and splendor in it; and there are those
who think that whatever ardor of imagination, or
love for brilliant color or music may belong to our
English race is due to old interfusion of British
blood. Certainly the lively plaids of the Highlander
and his bagpipes show love for much color
and exuberant gush of sound; and we all understand
that the Celtic Irishman has an appetite
for a shindy which demonstrates a rather lively
emotional nature.</p>

<h3>Beginning of English Learning.</h3>

<p>But over that ancient England covered with its alternating
fens and forests, and grimy Saxon hamlets,
and Celtic companies of huts, there streams
presently a new civilizing influence. It is in the
shape of Christian monks<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> sent by Pope Gregory the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
Great, who land upon the island of Thanet near the
Thames mouth (whereabout are now the bustling little
watering places of Ramsgate and Margate), and
march two by two&mdash;St. Augustine among them and
towering head and shoulders above the rest&mdash;bearing
silver crosses and singing litanies, up to the halls
of Ethelbert&mdash;near to the very site where now stands,
in those rich Kentish lands, the august and beautiful
Cathedral of Canterbury. There, too, sprung up
in those earlier centuries that Canterbury School,
where letters were taught, and learned men congregated,
and whence emerged that famous scholar&mdash;Aldhelm,<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
of whom the great King Alfred speaks admiringly;
who not only knew his languages but could
sing a song; a sort of early Saxon Sankey who
beguiled wanderers into better ways by his homely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
rhythmic utterance. I think we may safely count
this old Aldhelm, who had a strain of royal blood in
him, as the first of English ballad-mongers.</p>

<p>From the north of England, too, there was at almost
the same date, another gleam of crosses, coming
by way of Ireland and Iona, where St. Columba,<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
commemorated in one of Wordsworth’s Sonnets,
had established a monastery. We have the good old
Irish monk’s lament at leaving his home in Ireland for
the northern wilderness; there is true Irish fervor in
it:&mdash;“From the high prow I look over the sea, and
great tears are in my gray eyes when I turn to Erin&mdash;to
Erin, where the songs of the birds are so
sweet, and where the clerks sing like the birds;
where the young are so gentle, and the old so wise;
where the great men are so noble to look at, and
the women so fair to wed.”</p>

<p>Ruined remnants of the Iona monastery are still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
to be found on that little Western island&mdash;within
hearing almost of the waves that surge into the
caves of Staffa. And from this island stand-point,
the monkish missions were established athwart
Scotland; finding foothold too all down the coast of
Northumberland. Early among these and very notable,
was the famous Abbey of Lindisfarne or the
Holy Isle, not far southward from the mouth of the
Tweed. You will recall the name as bouncing
musically, up and down, through Scott’s poem of
“Marmion.” A little farther to the south, upon the
Yorkshire coast, came to be established, shortly
afterward, the Whitby monastery; its ruins make
now one of the shows of Whitby town&mdash;one of the
favorite watering places of the eastern coast of England,
and well known for giving its name to what is
called Whitby jet&mdash;which is only a finer sort of
bituminous coal, of which there are great beds
in the neighborhood.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> The Abbey ruin is upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
heights, from which are superb views out upon
the German Sea that beats with grand uproar upon
the Whitby cliffs. To the westward is the charming
country of Eskdale, and by going a few miles
southward one may come to Robinhood’s bay;
and in the intervening village of Hawsker may
be seen the two stones said to mark the flight
of the arrows of Robinhood and Little John,
when they tried their skill for the amusement of
the monks of Whitby.</p>

<h3>Cædmon.</h3>

<p>Well, in the year of our Lord 637, this Whitby
Abbey was founded by the excellent St. Hilda, and
it was under her auspices, and by virtue of her
saintly encouragements, that the first true English
poet, Cædmon, began to sing his Christian
song of the creation. He was but a cattle-tender&mdash;unkempt&mdash;untaught,
full of savagery, but with
a fine phrenzy in him, which made his paraphrase
of Scripture a spur, and possibly&mdash;in a certain
imperfect sense, a model for the muse of John
Milton.</p>

<p>Of the chaos before creation, he says:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent5">Earth’s surface was</div>
<div class="verse">With grass not yet be-greened; while far and wide</div>
<div class="verse">The dusky ways, with black unending night</div>
<div class="verse">Did ocean cover.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Of the great Over-Lord God-Almighty, he says&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>And again,&mdash;that you may make for yourselves
comparison with the treatment and method of Milton,&mdash;I
quote this picture of Satan in hell:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Within him boiled his thoughts about his heart;</div>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>There is but one known MS. copy of this poem.
It is probably of the tenth, certainly not later than
the eleventh century, and is in the Bodleian Library
at Oxford. It is illuminated, and some scenes
represented seem to have been taken from the old
miracle plays.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> It was printed in 1655: in this
form a copy is said to have reached the hands of Milton,
through a friend of the printer: and it may
well be that the stern old Puritan poet was moved
by a hearing of it,&mdash;for he was blind at this date,&mdash;to
the prosecution of that grand task which has
made his name immortal.</p>

<h3>Beda.</h3>

<p>We might, however, never have known anything of
Cædmon and of Saint Hilda and all the monasteries
north and south, except for another worthy who grew
up in the hearing of the waves which beat on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
cliffs of north-eastern England. This was Beda,&mdash;respected
in his own day for his industry, piety,
straightforward honesty&mdash;and so followed by the
respect of succeeding generations as to get and carry
the name of the <em>Venerable</em> Beda. Though familiar
with the people’s language,<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> and with Greek,
he wrote in monkish Latin&mdash;redeemed by classic
touches&mdash;and passed his life in the monastery at
Jarrow, which is on the Tyne, near the coast of
Durham, a little to the westward of South Shields.
An ancient church is still standing amid the ruins
of the monastic walls, and a heavy, straight-backed
chair of oak (which would satisfy the most zealous
antiquarian by its ugliness) is still guarded in the
chancel, and is called Beda’s Chair.</p>

<p>Six hundred pupils gathered about him there, in
the old days, to be taught in physics, grammar,
rhetoric, music, and I know not what besides. So<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
learned and true was he, that the Pope would have
called him to Rome; but he loved better the wooded
Tyne banks, and the gray moorlands, and the labors
of his own monastery. There he lived out an honest,
a plodding, an earnest, and a hopeful life. And as
I read the sympathetic story of its end, and of how
the old man&mdash;his work all done&mdash;lifted up a broken
voice&mdash;on his last day&mdash;amidst his scholars, to the
<cite>Gloria in Excelsis</cite>&mdash;I bethink me of his last eulogist,
the young historian, who within a few months only
after sketching that tender picture of his great forerunner
in the paths of British history, laid down his
brilliant pen&mdash;his work only half done, and died,
away from his home, at Mentone, on the shores of
the Mediterranean.</p>

<h3>King Alfred.</h3>

<p>A half century after the death of Beda began the
Danish invasions, under which, monasteries churches
schools went down in a flood of blood and fire. As
we read of that devastation&mdash;the record covering
only a half-page of the old Saxon Chronicle (begun
after Beda’s time)&mdash;it seems an incident; yet the piratic
storm, with intermittent fury, stretches over a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
century and more of ruin. It was stayed effectively
for a time when the great Alfred came to full power.</p>

<p>I do not deal much in dates: but you should
have a positive date for this great English king:
a thousand years ago (889) fairly marks the period
when he was in the prime of life&mdash;superintending,
very likely, the building of a British fleet
upon the Pool, below London. He was born at
Wantage, in Berkshire, a little to the south of the
Great Western Railway; and in a glade near to the
site of the old Saxon palace, is still shown what is
called Alfred’s Well. In the year 1849 his birthday
was celebrated, after the lapse of a thousand years&mdash;so
keen are these British cousins of ours to keep
alive all their great memories. And Alfred’s is a
memory worth keeping. He had advantages&mdash;as
we should say&mdash;of foreign travel; as a boy he went
to Rome, traversing Italy and the Continent. If
we could only get a good story of that cross-country
trip of his!</p>

<p>We know little more than that he came to high
honor at Rome, was anointed king there, before yet
he had come to royalty at home. He makes also a
second visit in company with his father Ethelwolf:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
and on their return Ethelwolf relieves the
tedium of travel by marrying the twelve-year old
daughter of Charles the Bald of France. Those
were times of extraordinary daring.</p>

<p>The great king had throughout a most picturesque
and adventurous life: he is hard pushed by
the Danes&mdash;by rivals&mdash;by his own family; one while
a wanderer on the moors&mdash;another time disguised
as minstrel in the enemy’s camp; but always high-hearted,
always hopeful, always working. He is oppressed
by the pall of ignorance that overlays the
lordly reach of his kingdom: “Scarce a priest have
I found,” says he, “south of the Thames who can
render Latin into English.” He is not an apt
scholar himself, but he toils at learning; his abbots
help him; he revises old chronicles, and
makes people to know of Beda; he has boys taught
to write in English; gives himself with love to the
rendering of Boëthius’ “Consolation of Philosophy.”
He adopts its reasoning, and plants his hope
on the creed&mdash;</p>

<p>1st. That a wise God governs.</p>

<p>2d. That all suffering may be made helpful.</p>

<p>3d. That God is chiefest good.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>4th. That only the good are happy.</p>

<p>5th. That the foreknowledge of God does not conflict
with Free-will.</p>

<p>These would seem to carry even now the pith and
germ of the broadest theologic teachings.</p>

<p>It is a noble and a picturesque figure&mdash;that of
King Alfred&mdash;which we see, looking back over the
vista of a thousand years; better it would seem than
that of King Arthur to weave tales around, and
illumine with the heat and the flame of poesy. Yet
poets of those times and of all succeeding times
have strangely neglected this august and royal
type of manhood.</p>

<p>After him came again weary Danish wars and
wild blood-letting and ignorance surging over the
land, save where a little light played fitfully around
such great religious houses as those of York and
Canterbury. It was the dreary Tenth Century, on
the threshold of which he had died&mdash;the very core
and kernel of the Dark Ages, when the wisest
thought the end of things was drawing nigh, and
strong men quaked with dread at sight of an
eclipse, or comet, or at sound of the rumble of an
earthquake. It was a time and a condition of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
gloom which made people pardon, and even relish
such a dismal poem as that of “The Grave,” which&mdash;though
bearing thirteenth century form&mdash;may
well in its germ have been a fungal outgrowth of
the wide-spread hopelessness of this epoch:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">For thee was a house built</div>
<div class="verse">Ere thou wert born;</div>

<div class="verse">Nor its depth measured,</div>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>From the death of Alfred (901) to the Norman
Conquest (1066) there was monkish work done in
shape of Homilies, Chronicles, grammars of Latin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
and English&mdash;the language settling more and more
into something like a determined form of what is
now called Anglo-Saxon. But in that lapse of
years I note only three historic incidents, which
by reason of the traditions thrown about them,
carry a piquant literary flavor.</p>

<h3>Canute and Godiva.</h3>

<p>The <em>first</em> is when the famous Canute, king of both
England and Denmark, and having strong taste for
song and music and letters, rows by the towers of
a great East-England religious house, and as he
drifts with the tide, composes (if we may trust
tradition) a snatch of verse which has come down
to us in a thirteenth century form, about the
pleasant singing of the Monks of Ely. Wordsworth
has embalmed the matter in one of his Ecclesiastic
Sonnets (xxx.):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">A pleasant music floats along the mere,</div>
<div class="verse">From monks in Ely chanting service high,</div>
<div class="verse">While as Canute the king is rowing by;</div>
<div class="verse">My oarsman, quoth the mighty king, draw near</div>
<div class="verse">That we the sweet songs of the monks may hear.</div>
<div class="verse">He listens (all past conquests and all schemes</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Of future vanishing like empty dreams)</div>
<div class="verse">Heart-touched, and haply not without a tear,</div>
<div class="verse">The royal minstrel, ere the Choir is still,</div>
<div class="verse">While his free barge skims the smooth flood along</div>
<div class="verse">Gives to the rapture an accordant Rhyme</div>
<div class="verse">O suffering Earth! be thankful; sternest Clime</div>
<div class="verse">And rudest Age are subject to the thrill</div>
<div class="verse">Of heaven-descended piety and song.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>I think you will never go under the wondrous
arches of Ely Cathedral&mdash;and you should go there
if you ever travel into the eastern counties of England&mdash;without
thinking of King Canute and of
that wondrous singing of the monks, eight hundred
years ago.</p>

<p>The <em>second</em> historic incident of which I spoke, is
the murder of King Duncan by Macbeth in the year
1039, some twenty-five years before the Norman
Conquest. I don’t think you want any refreshing
about Macbeth.</p>

<p>The <em>third</em> incident is of humbler tone, yet it went
to show great womanly devotion, and lifted a tax
from the heads of a whole towns-people. I refer to
the tradition of Earl Leofric of Mercia and the Lady
Godiva of Coventry, based in the main, without
doubt, upon actual occurrence, and the subject for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
centuries of annual commemoration.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Tennyson
tells, in his always witching way, how</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">She rode forth clothéd on with chastity:</div>
<div class="verse">The deep air listened round her as she rode,</div>
<div class="verse indent13">&mdash;&mdash;the barking cur</div>
<div class="verse">Made her cheek flame; her palfry’s foot-fall shot</div>
<div class="verse">Light horror thro’ her pulses:</div>
<div class="verse">One low churl compact of thankless earth</div>
<div class="verse">Peep’d&mdash;but his eyes, before they had their will</div>
<div class="verse">Were shrivelled into darkness in his head,</div>
<div class="verse">And she, that knew not, pass’d; and all at once</div>
<div class="verse">With twelve great shocks of sound, the shameless noon</div>
<div class="verse">Was clash’d and hammered from a hundred towers,</div>
<div class="verse">One after one: But even then she gained</div>
<div class="verse">Her bower; whence re-issuing, robed and crowned,</div>
<div class="verse">To meet her lord, she took the tax away</div>
<div class="verse">And built herself an everlasting name.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Observe&mdash;that I call up these modern writers and
their language, out of their turn as may seem to
you, only that I may plant more distinctly in your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
thought the old incidents to which their words relate.
It is as if I were speaking to you of some long-gone
line of ancestors, and on a sudden should call
up some delicate blond child and say&mdash;This one is
in the line of direct descent; she bears the same old
name, she murmurs the same old tunes; and this
shimmer of gold in her hair is what shone on the
heads of the good Saxon foreparents.</p>

<h3>William the Norman.</h3>

<p>We now come to a date to be remembered, and
in the neighborhood of which our first morning’s
talk will come to an end. It is the date of the Norman
Conquest&mdash;1066&mdash;that being the year of the
Battle of Hastings, when the brave Harold, last of
the Saxon kings went down, shot through the eye;
and the lithe, clean-faced, smirking William of Normandy
“gat him” the throne of England. These
new-comers were not far-away cousins of our Saxon
and Danish forefathers; only so recently as the
reign of Alfred had they taken permanent foothold
in that pleasant Norman country.</p>

<p>But they have not brought the Norse speech of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
the old home land with them: they have taken to a
Frankish language&mdash;we will call it Norman French&mdash;which
is thenceforth to blend with the Saxonism
of Alfred, until two centuries or more later, our
own mother English&mdash;the English of Chaucer and
of Shakespeare&mdash;is evolved out of the union. Not
only a new tongue, do these conquerors bring with
them, but madrigals and ballads and rhyming histories;
they have great contempt for the stolid,
lazy-going Latin records of the Saxon Chroniclers;
they love a song better. In the very face of the
armies at Hastings, their great minstrel <em>Taillefer</em>
had lifted up his voice to chant the glories of Roland,
about which all the histories of the time will
tell you.</p>

<p>It was a new civilization (not altogether Christian)
out-topping the old. These Normans knew more of
war&mdash;knew more of courts&mdash;knew more of affairs.
They loved money and they loved conquest. To
love one in those days, was to love the other. King
William swept the monasteries clean of those ignorant
priests who had dozed there, from the time of
Alfred, and put in Norman Monks with nicely
clipped hair, who could construe Latin after latest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
Norman rules. He new parcelled the lands, and
gave estates to those who could hold and manage
them. It was as if a new, sharp eager man of business
had on a sudden come to the handling of some
old sleepily conducted counting-room; he cuts off
the useless heads; he squares the books; he stops
waste; pity or tenderness have no hearing in his
shop.</p>

<p>I mentioned not far back an old Saxon Chronicle,
which all down the years, from shortly after Beda’s
day, had been kept alive&mdash;sometimes under the
hands of one monastery, sometimes of another; here
is what its Saxon Scribe of the eleventh century says
of this new-come and conquering Norman King: It
is good Saxon history, and in good Saxon style:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“King William was a very wise man, and very rich, more
worshipful and strong than any of his foregangers. He was
mild to good men who loved God; and stark beyond all
bounds to those who withsaid his will. He had Earls in his
bonds who had done against his will; Bishops he set off
their bishoprics; Abbots off their abbotries, and thanes in
prison. By his cunning he was so thoroughly acquainted
with England, that there is not a hide of land of which he
did not know, both who had it, and what was its worth. He
planted a great preserve for deer, and he laid down laws
therewith, that whoever should slay hart or hind should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
blinded. He forbade the harts and also the boars to be
killed. As greatly did he love the tall deer as if he were
their father.… He took from his subjects many
marks of gold, and many hundred pounds of silver; and
<em>that</em> he took&mdash;some by right, and some by mickle might
for very little need. He had fallen into avarice; and
greediness he loved withal. Among other things is not to
be forgotten the good peace that he made in this land; so
that a man who had any confidence in himself might go over
his realm, with his bosom full of gold, unhurt. Nor durst
any man slay another man had he done ever so great evil to
the other.… Brytland (Wales) was in his power, and
he therein wrought castles, and completely ruled over that
race of men.… Certainly in his time men had great
hardship, and very many injuries.… His rich men
moaned, and the poor men murmured; but he was so hard
that he recked not the hatred of them all. For it was need
they should follow the King’s will, if they wished to live,
or to have lands or goods. Alas, that any man should be
so moody, and should so puff up himself, and think himself
above all other men! May Almighty God show mercy
to his soul, and grant him forgiveness of his sins.”</p>

</div>

<p>There are other contemporary Anglo-Saxon annalists,
and there are the rhyming chroniclers of Norman
blood, who put a better color upon the qualities
of King William; but I think there is no one of
them, who even in moments of rhetorical exaltation,
thinks of putting William’s sense of justice, or his
kindness of heart, before his greed or his self-love.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<h3>Harold the Saxon.</h3>

<p>The late Lord Lytton (Bulwer) gave to this period
and to the closing years of Harold one of the
most elaborate of his Historic Studies. He availed
himself shrewdly of all the most picturesque aspects
(and they were very many) in the career of Harold,
and found startling historic facts enough to supply
to the full his passion for exaggerated melodrama.
There are brilliant passages in his book,<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> and a great
wealth of archæologic material; he shows us the
remnants of old Roman villas&mdash;the crude homeliness
of Saxon house surroundings&mdash;the assemblage
of old Palace Councils. Danish battle-axes,
and long-bearded Saxon thanes, and fiery-headed
Welshmen contrast with the polished and insidious
Normans. Nor is there lacking a heavy and much
over-weighted quota of love-making and misfortune,
and joy and death. Tennyson has taken the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
subject, using the same skeleton of story for his
play of Harold. It would seem that he has depended
on the romance of Bulwer for his archæology; and
indeed the book is dedicated to the younger Lord
Lytton (better known in the literary world as
“Owen Meredith”). As a working play, it is
counted, like all of Tennyson’s&mdash;a failure; but
there are passages of exceeding beauty.</p>

<p>He pictures the King Harold&mdash;the hero that he is&mdash;but
with a veil of true Saxon gloom lowering over
him: he tells the story of his brother Tostig’s jealous
wrath,&mdash;always in arms against Harold: he tells
of the hasty oath, which the king in young days
had sworn to William in Normandy, never to claim
England’s throne: and this oath hangs like a cloud
over the current of Harold’s story. The grief, and
noble devotion of poor Edith, the betrothed bride
of the king, whom he is compelled by a devilish diplomacy
to discard&mdash;is woven like a golden thread
into the woof of the tale: and Aldwyth, the queen,
whom Harold did not and can never love, is set off
against Edith&mdash;in Tennyson’s own unmatchable way
in the last scenes of the tragedy.</p>

<p>We are in the camp at Hastings: the battle waits;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
a vision of Norman saints, on whose bones Harold
had sworn that dreadful oath, comes to him in his
trance:&mdash;They say&mdash;(these wraiths of saints)&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>And he did affront it bravely; and the arrow did
slay him, near to the spot where the Saxon standard
flew to the breeze on that fateful day.</p>

<p>The play from which I have quoted may have
excess of elaboration and an over-finesse in respect
of details: but there are great bold reaches of
descriptive power, a nobility of sentiment, and
everywhere tender and winning touches, which will
be very sure to give to the drama of Tennyson permanence
and historic dignity, and keep it always a
literary way-mark in the fields we have gone over.
The scene of that decisive contest is less than a two
hours’ ride away from London (by the Southeastern
Railway) at a village called Battle&mdash;seven miles
from the coast line at Hastings&mdash;in the midst of a
beautiful rolling country, with scattered copses of
ancient wood and a great wealth of wild flowers&mdash;(for
which the district is remarkable) sparkling
over the fields.</p>

<p>The Conqueror built a great abbey there&mdash;Battle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
Abbey&mdash;whose ruins are visited by hundreds
every year. A large portion of the old religious
house, kept in excellent repair, and very charming
with its growth of ivy and its embowering shade,
is held in private hands&mdash;being the occasional
residence of the Duke of Cleveland. Amid the
ruins the usher will guide one to a crypt of the
ancient chapel&mdash;whose solid Norman arches date
back to the time of the Conqueror, and which is
said to mark the very spot on which Harold fell,
wounded to the death, on that memorable day of
Hastings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>




<h2 id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class="dropcap">I recur a moment to what was said in our
opening talk&mdash;as a boy will wisely go back a
little way for a better jump forward. I spoke&mdash;the
reader will remember&mdash;of ringing, Celtic war-songs,
which seemed to be all of literature that was drifting
in the atmosphere, when we began: then there
came a gleam of Christian light and of monkish
learning thro’ St. Augustine in Southern England;
and another gleam through Iona, and Lindisfarne,
from Irish sources; then came Cædmon’s Bible
singing,&mdash;which had echo far down in Milton’s day;
next the good old Beda, telling the story of these
things; then&mdash;a thousand years ago,&mdash;the Great
Alfred, at once a book-maker and a King. Before
him and after him came a dreary welter of Danish
wars; the great Canute&mdash;tradition says&mdash;chirping
a song in the middle of them; and last, the slaughter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
of Hastings, where the Saxon Harold went down,
and the conquering Norman came up.</p>

<h3>Geoffrey of Monmouth.</h3>

<p>We start to-day with an England that has its
office-holding and governing people speaking one
language&mdash;its moody land-holders and cultivators
speaking another&mdash;and its irascible Britons in
Wales and Cumbria and Cornwall speaking yet another.
Conquered people are never in much mood
for song-singing or for history-making. So there is
little or nothing from English sources for a century or
more. Even the old Saxon Chronicle kept by monks
(at Peterboro in this time), does not grow into a
stately record, and in the twelfth century on the year
of the death of King Stephen, dies out altogether.</p>

<p>But there is a Welsh monk&mdash;Geoffrey of Monmouth<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>&mdash;living
just on the borders of Wales, and
probably not therefore brought into close connection
with this new Norman element&mdash;who writes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
(about one hundred years after the Conquest) a half-earnest
and mostly-fabulous British Chronicle. He
professes to have received its main points from a
Walter&mdash;somebody, who had rare old bookish secrets
of history, derived from Brittany, in his keeping.
You will remember, perhaps, how another
and very much later writer&mdash;sometimes known as
Geoffrey Crayon&mdash;once wrote a History of New York,
claiming that it was made up from the MSS. of a
certain Diedrich Knickerbocker: I think that perhaps
the same sense of quiet humor belonged to both
these Geoffreys. Certainly Geoffrey of Monmouth’s
Chronicle bears about the same relation to British
matters of fact which the Knickerbocker story of New
York bears to the colonial annals of our great city.</p>

<p>The fables which were told in this old Monmouth
Chronicle are more present in men’s minds to-day
than the things which were real in it: there was,
for instance, the fable about King Lear (who does
not know King Lear?): then, there were the greater
fables about good King Arthur and his avenging
Caliburn (who does not know King Arthur?).
These two stories are embalmed now in Literature,
and will never perish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<h3>King Arthur Legends.</h3>

<p>Those Arthur legends had been floating about in
ballad or song, but they never had much mention in
anything pretending to be history<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> until Geoffrey of
Monmouth’s day. There is nothing of them in the
Saxon Chronicle: nothing of them in Beda: King
Alfred never mentions King Arthur.</p>

<p>But was there ever a King Arthur? Probably:
but at what precise date is uncertain: probable, too,
that he had his court&mdash;as many legends run&mdash;one
time at Caerleon, “upon Usk,” and again at
Camelot.<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> Caerleon is still to be found by the curious
traveller, in pleasant Monmouthshire, just upon
the borders of Wales, with Tintern Abbey and the
grand ruin of Chepstow not far off; and a great
amphitheatre among the hills (very likely of Roman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
origin) with green turf upon it, and green hillsides
hemming it in&mdash;is still called King Arthur’s
Round Table.</p>

<p>Camelot is not so easy to trace: the name will not
be found in the guide-books: but in Somersetshire,
in a little parish, called “Queen’s Camel,” are the remains
of vast entrenchments, said to have belonged
to the tourney ground of Camelot. A little branch of
the Yeo River (you will remember this name, if you
have ever read Charles Kingsley’s “Westward, Ho”&mdash;a
book you should read)&mdash;a little branch, I say, of
the Yeo runs through the parish, and for irrigating
purposes is held back by dykes, and then shot, shining,
over the green meadows: hence, Tennyson may
say truly, as he does in his Idyls of the King&mdash;</p>

<p>There are some features of this ancient fable of
King Arthur, which are of much older literary date
than the times we are now speaking of. Thus “the
dusky barge,” that appears on a sudden&mdash;coming
to carry off the dying King,&mdash;</p>

<p class="noindent">has a very old germ;&mdash;Something not unlike this
watery bier, to carry a dead hero into the Silences,
belongs to the opening of that ancient poem of
Beowulf&mdash;which all students of early English
know and prize&mdash;but which did not grow on
English soil, and therefore does not belong to our
present quest.<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> The brand Excalibur, too, which
is thrown into the sea by King Arthur’s friend,
and which is caught by an arm clothed in white
samite, rising from the mere, and three times brandished,
has its prototype in the “old mighty sword”
which is put into the hands of Beowulf before he can
slay the great sea-dragon of the Scandinavian fable.</p>

<p>Now, these Arthurian stories, put into book by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
Geoffrey&mdash;a Latin book, for all the monks wrote in
Latin, though they may have sung songs in English,
as good father Aldhelm did&mdash;were presently caught
up by a romance-writer, named Wace, who was living
at Caen, in Normandy, and whose knightly
cousins (some say father and titled baron) had come
over with William the Conqueror,&mdash;the name being
long known in Nottinghamshire. This Wace put
these Arthur stories into Norman verse&mdash;adding
somewhat and giving a French air, which made his
book sought after and read in royal courts; and fragments
of it were chanted by minstrels in castle halls.</p>

<p>Then, this Arthur mine of legends was explored
again by another priest and Welshman, who came
to have some place at Oxford, where the beginnings
of the great university were then a-brew. This
writer, Walter Map<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> by name&mdash;or Mapes, as he is
sometimes called&mdash;lived just about the meeting of
the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, when the crusades
were in full blast, and when dreams about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
Holy Sepulchre hovered round half the house roofs
of England. People saw in visions the poor famished
pilgrims, fainting with long marches toward
the far-away Jerusalem, and shot down by cruel
Saracen arrows, within sight of the Holy of Holies.
So Walter Map, the priest (they say he was one
while chaplain to Henry II.), writing under light of
that fierce enthusiasm, puts a religious element into
the Arthur stories; and it is from him&mdash;in all probability&mdash;comes
that Legend of the Holy Graal&mdash;the
cup which caught the sacred blood, and which
saintly knights were to seek after, the pure Sir
Galahad being the winning seeker.</p>

<p>Nor did the Arthur legends stop here: but another
priestly man, Layamon<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>&mdash;he, too, living
on the borders of Wales, in the foraging ground of
Arthur’s knights, not far from the present town of
Kidderminster (which we know carpet-wise)&mdash;set
himself to turning the Legends, with many additions,
into short, clanging, alliterative Saxon verses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
with occasional rhyme&mdash;the first English (or Teutonic)
wording of the story; Map’s version being in
Latin and French. He copies very much from Wace
(<cite>Le Brut d’Angleterre</cite>), but his book is longer by a
half. It has its importance, too&mdash;this Layamon version&mdash;in
the history of the language. Of the why
and the how, and of its linguistic relations to the
Anglo-Saxon, or the modern tongue, I shall leave
discussion in the hands of those more instructed in
the history of Early English. We know this Layamon
in our present writing, only as a simple-minded,
good, plodding, West-of-England priest, who asked
God’s blessing on his work, and who put that quaint
alliterative jingle in it, which in years after was spent
in larger measure over the poem of Piers Plowman,
and which, still later, comes to even daintier usage
when the great master&mdash;Spenser</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“&mdash;&mdash;fills with flowers fair Flora’s painted lap.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Even now we are not through with this story of
the Arthurian legends: it does not end with the
priest Layamon. After printing was invented, and
an easier way of making books was in vogue than
the old one of tediously copying them upon parchment&mdash;I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
say in this new day of printing a certain
Sir Thomas Mallory, who lived at the same time
with Caxton, the first English printer, did, at the
instance, I think, of that printer&mdash;put all these legends
we speak of into rather stiff, homely English
prose&mdash;copying, Caxton tells us, from a French
original: but no such full French original has been
found; and the presumption is that Mallory borrowed
(as so many book-makers did and do) up
and down, from a world of manuscripts. And he
wrought so well that his work had great vogue, and
has come to frequent issue in modern times, under
the hands of such editors as Southey, Wright,
Strachey and Lanier. In the years following Mallory,
succeeding writers poached frequently upon
the old Arthur preserve&mdash;bit by bit<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>&mdash;till at last,
in our day, Tennyson told his “Idyl of the King”&mdash;</p>

<h3>Early Norman Kings.</h3>

<p>We come back now from this chase of Arthur, to
the time of the Early Norman Kings: Orderic Vitalis,<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
of Normandy, William of Malmsbury,<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Matthew
Paris,<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> William of Newburgh,<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> (whose record
has just now been re-edited and printed in England,)
and Roger of Hoveden,<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> were chroniclers of this period;
but I am afraid these names will hardly be kept
in mind. Indeed, it is not worth much struggle to
do so, unless one is going into the writing of History
on his own account. Exception ought perhaps to be
made in favor of Matthew Paris, who was a monk of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
St. Albans, who won his name from studying at Paris
(as many live students of that day did), who put a
brave and vehement Saxonism of thought into his
Latin speech&mdash;who had art enough to illustrate his
own Chronicle with his pencil, and honesty enough
to steer by God’s rule only and not by the King’s.
One should remember, too, that this was about the
period of the best Provençal balladry (in which
Richard Cœur de Lion was proficient);&mdash;that strain
of mediæval music and love regaling the Crusader
knights on their marches toward Judea, and that
strain of music and love waking delightful echoes
against Norman castle-walls on their return. Again,
one should keep note of the year when <cite>Magna
Charta</cite> was granted by King John (1215), and remember,
furthermore, that within ten years of the
same date (1205) Layamon probably put the finishing
touches to his <cite>Brut</cite>, and the Arthurian stories I
was but now speaking of.</p>

<p>Throughout these times&mdash;we will say the twelfth
century and early in the thirteenth,&mdash;England was
waxing every day stronger, though it grew strong
in a rough and bloody way; the great Norman
castles were a-building up and down the land&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>such
as Conway and Rochester and Cardiff and
Kenilworth: the older cathedrals, too, such as Durham
and Winchester and Canterbury and Ely were
then piling column by column and vault by vault
toward the grand proportions which amaze us to-day.
It was the time of growing trade too: ships
from Genoa and Venice lay off the Thames banks,
and had brought thither cargoes of silks and glass,
jewels, Milanese armor, and spices. Cloth-makers
came over from Flanders and made settlements in
England.</p>

<p>Perhaps you have read Scott’s story of the “Betrothed.”
If so, you will remember his description
of just such a Flemish settlement in its earlier chapters,
with its Wilkin Flammock and its charming
Rose. The scene is laid in the time of Henry II.,
that sturdy King, who had such woful trouble with
his wild sons, Richard and John, and still larger
trouble with Thomas à Becket, (known now, as Harold
is known, by Tennyson’s tender music) who came to
his death at last by the King’s connivance, under the
arches of Canterbury Cathedral; and so made that
shrine sacred for pilgrims, whether they came from
the “Tabard Inn,” or otherwheres.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>That story of the “Betrothed” puts in presence
winningly, the threefold elements of English population
in that day&mdash;the Britons, the Saxons, and
the Normans. The Britons are pictured by a scene
of revel in the great rambling palace of a Welsh
King, where the bard Cadwallon sings, and that
other bard, Caradoc&mdash;both historic characters; and
it is upon a legend in the chronicle of the latter,
Southey has based his poem of “Madoc.” The Normans
are represented, in the same romance, by the
men-at-arms, or knights of the Castle of <cite>La Garde
Doloureuse</cite>, and the Saxons by the fierce old lady in
the religious house of Baldringham, where Eveline
the heroine, had such fearful experiences with hobgoblins
over night. There may be lapses in the
archæology&mdash;as where Scott puts a hewn fireplace
upon the wall of the dining-room of the Lady Ermengarde&mdash;antiquarians
being pretty well agreed
that chimneys of such class were unknown up to the
fourteenth century; but still the atmosphere of
twelfth-century life in England is better given than
in most of our histories.<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<h3>Richard Cœur de Lion.</h3>

<p>In the same connection and with same commendation,
may be named those other romances, “The
Talisman” and “Ivanhoe,” both relating to epochs
in the life of King Richard I. I suppose that of all
English people, who have any figure in their minds
of Richard Cœur de Lion, his bearing and character,
four-fifths will have derived the larger part of
their impressions from these two books of Scott. It
is a painting by a friendly hand: Scott loved kings;
and he loved the trace of Saxonism that was in
Richard’s blood; he loved his bravery, as every Englishman
always had and should. Is it quite needful
that the friendly painter should put in all the
bad birth-marks, or the bristling red beard? M.
Taine scores him savagely, and would have him a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
beast: and Thackeray, in his little story of Rebecca
and Rowena, uses a good deal of blood in the
coloring.</p>

<p>No doubt he was cruel: but those were days of
cruelty and of cruel kings. At least he was openly
cruel: he carried his big battle-axe in plain sight,
and if he met a foe thwacked him on the head
with it, and there was an end. But he did not kill
men on the sly like his brother King John, nor did
he poison men by inches in low dungeons, as did
so many of the polite and courteous Louis’ of
France.</p>

<p>As people say now&mdash;in a good Saxon way&mdash;you
knew where to find him. He was above-board, and
showed those traits of boldness and frankness which
almost make one forgive his cruelties. He was a
rough burr; and I daresay wiped his beard upon
the sleeve of his doublet, besides killing a great
many people he should not have killed, at Ascalon.
At any rate, we shall not set to work here to gainsay
or discredit those charming historic pictures of Scott.
We shall keep on going to the pleasant tournament-ground
at Ashby-de-la-Zouche every time the fanfare
of those trumpets breaks the silence of a leisure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
day; and so will our children; and so, I think, will
our children’s children. We shall keep on listening
to Wamba’s jokes, and keep on loving Rebecca, and
keep on&mdash;not thinking much of the airy Rowena,
and keep on throwing our caps in the air whenever
the big knight in black armor, who is Richard
of England, rides in upon the course&mdash;whatever
all the Frenchmen in the world may say about
him.</p>

<p>This Cœur de Lion appears too in the “Talisman”&mdash;one
of Scott’s tales of the crusaders: and
here we see him set off against other monarchs of
Europe; as we find England, also, set off against the
other kingdoms. The King came home, you will remember,
by the way of Austria, and was caught and
caged there many months&mdash;for a time none of his
people knowing where he was: this is good romance
and history too. A tradition, which probably has a
little of both, says his prison was discovered by
a brother minstrel, who wandered under castle-walls
in search of him, and sang staves of old Provençal
songs that were favorites of the King’s. Finally
Richard responded from the depths of his
dungeon. Howsoever this be, he was found, ransomed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
and came home&mdash;to the great grief of his
brother John; all which appears in the story of
Ivanhoe, and in the chronicles of the time&mdash;based
upon the reports of the King’s chaplain, Anselm.</p>

<h3>Times of King John.</h3>

<p>King John&mdash;a base fellow every way&mdash;has a date
made for him by the grant of <cite>Magna Charta</cite>, <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>
1215, of which I have already spoken, and of its
near coincidence with the writing of the <cite>Brut</cite> of
Layamon. His name and memory also cling to
mind in connection with two other events which
have their literary associations.</p>

<p>First, this scoundrelly King could only keep
power by making away with his little nephew
Arthur, and out of this tragedy Shakespeare has
woven his play of John&mdash;not very much read perhaps,
and rarely acted; but in the old, school
reader-books of my time there used to be excerpted
a passage&mdash;a whole scene, in fact&mdash;representing
the interview between Arthur and his gaoler
Hubert, who is to put out the poor boy’s eyes. I
quote a fragment:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><i>Arthur</i>&mdash;Must you with irons burn out both mine eyes?</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><i>Hubert</i>&mdash;Young boy, I must.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><i>Arthur</i>&mdash;And will you?</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><i>Hubert</i>&mdash;And I will.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><i>Arthur</i>&mdash;Have you the heart? When your head did but ache,</div>
<div class="verse">I knit my handkerchief about your brows.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And again, when the ruffians come in with the irons,
Hubert says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="verse">“Give me the irons, I say, and bind him here.”</div>
</div>

<div class="verse">I will not struggle; I will stand stone still;</div>
<div class="verse">For Heaven’s sake, Hubert, let me not be bound.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>I don’t know how young people are made up
nowadays; but in the old times this used to touch
us and almost set us upon the “weep” and make
us rank King John with Beelzebub and&mdash;the
Schoolmaster.</p>

<p>Second: In King John’s day Normandy was lost
to England&mdash;the loss growing largely, in fact, out
of the cruelty just named, and its ensuing wars.
Losing Normandy had a vast influence upon the
growing speech of England. Hitherto the cherished
mother-land had been across the channel. Sons of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
the well-born had been sent over to learn French
on French ground: young ladies of fashion ordered,
without doubt, their best cloaks and hats
from Rouen: the English ways of talk might do
for the churls and low-born: but it was discredited
by the more cultivated&mdash;above all by those who
made pursuit of the gayeties and elegancies of life.
The priest fraternity and the universities of course
kept largely by Latin; and the old British speech
only lived in the mountains and in the rattling war-songs
of the Welsh bards. But when Norman nobles
and knights found themselves cut off from their old
home associations with Normandy, and brought into
more intimate relations with the best of the English
population, there grew up a new pride in the
land and language of their adoption. Hence there
comes about a gradual weaning from France. London
begins to count for more than Rouen. The
Norman knights and barons very likely season
their talk with what they may have called English
slang; and the better taught of the islanders&mdash;the
sons of country franklins affected more knowledge
of the Norman tongue, and came to know the
French romances, which minstrels sang at their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
doors. So it was that slowly, and with results only
observable after long lapse of years, the nation and
language became compacted into one; and the new
English began to be taught in the schools.</p>

<h3>Mixed Language.</h3>

<p>Of the transition stage, as it was called, there
are narrative poems of record, which were written
with a couplet in Norman French, and then a couplet
in English. There were medleys, too, of these
times, in which the friars mingled the three tongues
of Latin, French, and English.<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> Blood mingled as
languages mingled; and by the middle of the fourteenth
century a man was no longer foreign because
he was of Norman descent, and no longer vulgar
because he was of Saxon.</p>

<p>To this transition time&mdash;in Henry III.’s day (who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
had a long reign of fifty-six years&mdash;chiefly memorable
for its length), there appeared the rhyming
Chronicle of Robert of Gloucester;<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>&mdash;what we
should call a doggerel story of England from fabulous
times down, and worthy of mention as the first
serious attempt at an English-written history&mdash;others
noticed already being either merely bald
chronicles, or in scholastic Latin, or in French metric
form. I give you a little taste of his wooden
verse&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent8">&mdash;&mdash;Lyncolne [has] fairest men,</div>
<div class="verse">Grantebrugge, and Hontyndon most plente ò deep fen,</div>
<div class="verse">Ely of fairest place, of fairest site Rochester,</div>
<div class="verse">Even agen Fraunce stonde ye countre ò Chichester,</div>
<div class="verse">Norwiche agen Denemark, Chestre agen Irelond,</div>
<div class="verse">Duram agen Norwei, as ich understonde.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Yet he tells us some things worth knowing&mdash;about
every-day matters&mdash;about the fish and the
fruits and the pastures, and the things he saw with
his own eyes. And we learn from these old chroniclers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
how much better a story a man can make, and
how much more worth it is&mdash;in telling of the things
he has really seen, than of the things he has not
seen. Most of these old writing people must needs
begin at the beginning&mdash;drawling over the ancient
fables about the Creation and Siege of Troy, keeping
by the conventional untruths, and so&mdash;very
barren and good for nothing, until they get upon
their own days, when they grow rich and meaty and
juicy, in spite of themselves, and by reason of their
voluble minuteness, and their mention of homely,
every-day unimportant things. They cannot tell
lies, without fear of detection, on their own ground:
and so they get that darlingest quality of all history&mdash;the
simple truth.</p>

<p>But if a man wanders otherwheres and makes report,
he may tell lies, and the lies may amuse and
get him fame. Thus it happened with another
well-known but somewhat apocryphal writer of this
Transition English epoch; I mean Sir John Mandeville,
whose book of travels into distant countries
had a very great run.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<h3>Sir John Mandeville.</h3>

<p>We know little of Mandeville except what he tells
us;&mdash;that he was born at St. Albans&mdash;twenty
miles from London, a place famous for its great
abbey and its Roman remains&mdash;in the year 1300:&mdash;that
he studied to be a mediciner&mdash;then set
off (1322) on his travels into Egypt, Tartary, China,
and Persia&mdash;countries visited by that more famous
Venetian traveller, Marco Polo,<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> a half century earlier;&mdash;also,
at other dates by certain wandering
Italian Friars<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> of less fame. From some of these
earlier travellers it is now made certain that Sir
John pilfered very largely;&mdash;so largely, in fact, and
so rashly, that there is reason to doubt, not only his
stories about having been in the service of a Sultan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
of Egypt or of the Khan of Kathay&mdash;as he avers&mdash;but
also to doubt if he visited at all the far-away
countries which he pretends to describe.</p>

<p>Nay, so deflowered is he of his honors in these
latter days, that recent critics<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> are inclined to question
his right to the title of Sir John, and to deny
wholly his authorship of that English version of the
tales of travel, which have been so long and pleasantly
associated with his name.</p>

<p>This seems rather hard measure to mete out to
the garrulous old voyager; nor does the evidence
against his having Englished his own <cite>Romance</cite> stories,
appear fully conclusive. What we may count for
certain about the matter is this:&mdash;There does exist
a very considerable budget of delightfully extravagant
travellers’ tales, bearing the Mandeville name,
and written in an English which&mdash;with some mending
of bygone words&mdash;is charming now: and which
may be called the first fair and square book of the
new English prose;&mdash;meaning by that&mdash;the first
book of length and of popular currency which introduced
a full measure&mdash;perhaps over-running<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
measure&mdash;of those words of Romance or Latin origin,
which afterward came to be incorporated in the
English of the fifteenth century. The book has no
English qualities&mdash;beyond its language; and might
have been written by a Tartar, who could tell of
Munchausen escapes and thank God in good current
dialect of Britain.</p>

<p>I give a specimen from the description of his descent
into the Valley Perilous&mdash;which he found beside
the Isle of Mistorak, nigh to the river Phison:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>This Vale is all full of devils, and hath been always. And
men say there that it is one of the entries of hell. In that
Vale is plenty of gold and silver; wherefore many misbelieving
men, and many Christians also, oftentimes go in, to have
of the treasure.… And in midplace of that Vale is an
head of the visage of a devil bodily&mdash;full horrible and dreadful
to see. But there is no man in the world so hardy, Christian
man, ne other, but that he would be drad [afraid] for
to behold it. For he beholdeth every man so sharply with
dreadful eyen that ben evermore moving and sparkling as
fire, and changeth and steereth so often in divers manner,
with so horrible countenance, that no man dare not nighen
toward him.</p>

<p>The author says fourteen of his party went in, and
when they came out&mdash;only nine: “And we wisten
never, whether that our fellows were lost or elles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
turned again for dread. But we never saw them
never after.” He says there were plenty of jewels
and precious stones thereabout, but “I touched
none, because that the Devils be so subtle to make
a thing to seem otherwise than it is, for to deceive
mankind.” He tells us also of the giants Gog and
Magog, and of a wonderful bird&mdash;like the roc of
Arabian Nights’ fable&mdash;that would carry off an elephant
in its talons, and he closes all his stupendous
narratives with thanks to God Almighty for his marvellous
escapes.</p>

<p>I have spoken of its popularity. Halliwell&mdash;who
edits the London edition of 1839&mdash;says that of no
book, with the exception of Scriptures, are there so
many MSS. of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries
existing; showing that for two centuries its fables
were either not exploded, or at least lost not their
relish.</p>

<h3>Early Book-making.</h3>

<p>And now what do we mean by books and by
popularity at the end of the thirteenth century?
The reader must keep in mind that our notion of
popularity measured by thousands of copies would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
then have been regarded as strange as the most
monstrous of Sir John Mandeville’s stories. There
was no printing; there was no paper, either&mdash;as
we understand. The art, indeed, of making paper
out of pulp did exist at this date with the Oriental
nations&mdash;perhaps with the Moors in Spain, but not
in England. Parchment made from skins was the
main material, and books were engrossed laboredly
with a pen or stylus. It was most likely a very popular
book which came to an edition of fifty or sixty
copies within five years of its first appearance: and
a good manuscript was so expensive an affair that
its purchase was often made a matter to be testified
to by subscribing witnesses, as we witness the
transfer of a house. A little budget of these manuscripts
made a valuable library. When St. Augustine
planted his Church in Kent&mdash;he brought nine
volumes with him as his literary treasure.</p>

<p>Lanfranc, who was one of the Norman abbots
brought over by the Conqueror to build up the
priesthood in learning, made order in 1072 that at
Lent the librarian should deliver to the worthiest of
the brotherhood each a book; and these were to
have a year to read them. At the commencement of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
the fourteenth century there were only four classics
in the royal library of Paris; and at the same date
the library of Oxford University consisted of a few
tracts kept in chests under St. Mary’s Church.&mdash;Green,
in his “Making of England,”<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> cites from
Alcuin a bit of that old Churchman’s Latin poem&mdash;“<cite>De
Pontificibus</cite>”&mdash;which he says is worthy of special
note, as the first catalogue which we have of
any English Library.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Quidquid Gregorius summus docet, et Leo Papa;</div>
<div class="verse">Basilius quidquid, Fulgentius atque, coruscant,</div>
<div class="verse">Cassiodorus item, Chrysostomus atque Johannes</div>
<div class="verse">Quidquid et Athelmus docuit, quid Beda magister.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Beda and Aldhelm are the only English writers
represented; and the catalogue&mdash;if we call it such&mdash;could
be written on a half-page of note paper&mdash;Metaphors
and Geography and Theology and decorative
epithets included.</p>

<p>Thus in these times a book was a book: some of
them cost large sums; the mere transcription into
plain black-letter or Old English was toilsome and
involved weeks and months of labor; and when it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
came to illuminated borders, or initials and title-pages
with decorative paintings, the labor involved
was enormous. There were collectors in those days
as now&mdash;who took royal freaks for gorgeous missals;
and monkish lives were spent in gratifying the
whims of such collectors. In the year 1237 (Henry
III.) there is entry in the Revenue Roll of the costs
of silver clasps and studs for the King’s <em>great book
of Romances</em>. Upon the continent, in Italy, where
an art atmosphere prevailed that was more enkindling
than under the fogs of this savage England,
such work became thoroughly artistic; and even
now beautiful <i lang="fr">motifs</i> for decoration on the walls of
New York houses are sought from old French or
Latin manuscripts of the thirteenth and fourteenth
centuries.</p>

<p>And where was this work of making books done?
There were no book-shops or publishers’ houses,
but in place of them abbeys or monasteries&mdash;each
having its <i lang="la">scriptorium</i> or writing-room, where,
under the vaulted Norman arches and by the dim
light of their loop-holes of windows, the work of
transcription went on month after mouth and year
after year. Thus it is recorded that in that old monastery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
of St. Albans (of which we just now spoke)
eighty distinct works were transcribed during the
reign of Henry VI.; it is mentioned as swift work;
and as Henry reigned thirty-nine years, it counts up
about two complete MSS. a year. And the atmosphere
of St. Albans was a learned one; this locality
not being overmuch given to the roisterings that
belonged to Bolton Priory&mdash;of which you will remember
the hint in a pleasant picture of Landseer’s.</p>

<h3>Religious Houses.</h3>

<p>If you or I had journeyed thither in that day&mdash;coming
from what land we might&mdash;I think we
should have been earnest among the first things,
to see those great monasteries that lay scattered
over the surface of England and of Southern Scotland;&mdash;not
perched on hills or other defensible
positions like the Norman castles of the robber
Barons&mdash;not buried in cities like London Tower,
or the great halls which belonged to guilds of merchants&mdash;but
planted in the greenest and loveliest
of valleys, where rivers full of fish rippled within
hearing, and woods full of game clothed every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
headland that looked upon the valley; where the
fields were the richest&mdash;where the water was purest&mdash;where
the sun smote warmest; there these religious
houses grew up, stone by stone, cloister by
cloister, chapel by chapel, manor by manor, until
there was almost a township, with outlying cottages&mdash;and
some great dominating abbey church&mdash;rich
in all the choicest architecture of the later Norman
days&mdash;lifting its spire from among the clustered
buildings scarce less lovely than itself.</p>

<p>Not only had learning and book-making been
kept alive in these great religious houses, but the
art of Agriculture. Within their walled courts were
grown all manner of fruits and vegetables known to
their climate; these monks knew and followed the
best rulings of Cato, and Crescenzius (who just
now has written on this subject in Northern Italy,
and is heard of by way of Padua). They make sour
wine out of grapes grown against sunny walls: they
have abundant flocks too&mdash;driven out each morning
from their sheltering courts, and returned each
night; and they have great breadth of ground under
carefullest tillage.</p>

<p>Of such character was Tintern Abbey&mdash;in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
valley of the Wye&mdash;now perhaps the most charming
of all English ruins. Such another was Netley
Abbey, on Southampton water, and Bolton Priory,
close by that famous stream, the Wharfe, which you
will remember in Wordsworth’s story of the “White
Doe of Rylstone.” Fountain’s Abbey, in Yorkshire,
was yet another, from whose ruin we can study
better perhaps than from any other in England,
the extent and disposition of these old religious
houses. Melrose was another; and so was Dryburgh,
where Scott’s body lies, and Abingdon, close
upon Oxford&mdash;where was attached that Manor of
Cumnor, which Scott assigns for a prison to the
sad-fated Amy Robsart, in the tale of “Kenilworth.”
Glastonbury was another: this too (once encircled
by the arms of the river Brue), was the “Isle of Avalon”
in Arthurian romance;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Where falls not hail, or rain or any snow,</div>
<div class="verse">Nor ever wind blows loudly.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Here (at Glastonbury) is still in existence the abbot’s
barn of the fourteenth century, and here, too, a magnificent
abbot’s kitchen&mdash;thirty-three feet square
and seventy-two feet high: Think what the cooking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
and the meats must have been in a kitchen of that
style!</p>

<p>Now, these shrewd people who lived in these
great monasteries, and built them, and enjoyed the
good things kept in store there&mdash;made friends of
the vassals about them; they were generous with
their pot-herbs and fruits; they were the medicine-men
of the neighborhood; they doled out flasks of
wine to the sick; they gave sanctuary and aid to
the Robin Hoods and Little Johns; and Robin
Hood’s men kept them in supply of venison; they
enlivened their courts with minstrelsy. Warton says
that at the feast of the installation of Ralph, Abbot
of St. Augustine’s, Canterbury, in 1309, seventy shillings
was expended for minstrels in the gallery, and
six thousand guests were present in and about the
halls. Many abbeys maintained minstrels or harpers
of their own; and we may be sure that the
monks had jolly as well as religious ditties.</p>

<p>They made friends of all strong and influential
people near them; their revenues were enormous.
They established themselves by all the arts of conciliation.
Finding among their young vassals one
keener and sharper witted than his fellows, they beguiled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
him into the abbey&mdash;instructed him&mdash;perhaps
made a clerk of him, for the transcription of
the MSS. we have spoken of (it was thus Cædmon
was brought into notice); if very promising, he
might come to place of dignity among the monks&mdash;possibly
grow, as Thomas à Becket did, from such
humble beginnings to an archbishopric and to the
mastership of the religious heart of England.</p>

<p>These houses were the fat corporations of that
day, with their lobby-men and spokesmen in all
state assemblages. Their representatives could wear
hair shirts, or purple robes and golden mitres, as
best suited the needs of the occasion. They could
boast that their institutions were established&mdash;like
our railways&mdash;for the good of the people, and in
the interests of humanity; but while rendering service,
waxing into such lustiness of strength and such
habits of corruption and rapacity, that at last, when
fully bloated, they were broken open and their
riches drifted away under the whirlwind of the
wrath of King Henry VIII. Great schemes of greed
are very apt to carry an avenging Henry VIII. somewhere
in their trail. But let us not forget that there
was a time in the early centuries of Christian England<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
when these great religious houses&mdash;whose
ruins appeal to us from their lovely solitudes&mdash;were
the guardians of learning, the nurses of all
new explorations into the ways of knowledge, the
expounders of all healing arts, and the promoters of
all charities and all neighborly kindliness.<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> Whatever
young fellow of that day did not plant himself
under shadow of one of these religious houses
for growth, or did not study in the schools of
Oxford or Cambridge, must needs have made his
way into favor and fame and society with a lance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
and good horse&mdash;just as young fellows do it now
with an oar or a racket.</p>

<h3>Life of a Damoiselle.</h3>

<p>But what shall be said of a young person of the
other sex of like age and tastes&mdash;to whose ambitions
war and knight-errantry and the university
cloisters are not open? Whither should the daughters
of the great houses go, or how fill up the current
of their young lives in that old thirteenth-century
England?</p>

<p>It is true, there are religious houses&mdash;nunneries&mdash;priories&mdash;for
these, too, with noble and saintly
prioresses, such as St. Hilda’s, St. Agatha’s, St. Margaret’s;
all these bountiful in their charities, strict
for most part in their discipline. To these cloistered
schools may go the cousins, sisters, nieces of
these saintly lady superiors; here they may learn
of music, of embroidery, of letter-writing, and
Christian carols&mdash;in Latin or English or French,
as the case may be. If not an inmate of one
of these quiet cloisters, our young thirteenth-century
damsel will find large advantage in its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
neighborhood; in the interchange of kindly offices&mdash;in
the loan of illuminated missals, of fruits, of
flowers, of haunches of venison, and in the assurance
that tenderest of nurses and consolers will be
at hand in case of illness or disaster; and always
there&mdash;an unfailing sanctuary. At home, within
the dingy towers of a castle or squat Saxon homestead,
with walls hung in tapestry, or made only
half bright with the fire upon the hearthstone&mdash;with
slits of windows filled with horn or translucent
bits of skin&mdash;there must have been wearisome <i lang="fr">ennui</i>.
Yet even here there were the deft handmaids,
cheery and companionable; the games&mdash;draughts
of a surety (in rich houses the checkers being of
jasper or rock crystal); the harp, too, and the falcons
for a hunting bout in fair weather; the little
garden within the court&mdash;with its eglantine, its
pinks, its lilies fair. Possibly there may be also
transcripts of old <i lang="fr">chansons</i> between ivory lids&mdash;images
carven out of olive wood&mdash;relics brought to
the castle by friendly knights from far-away Palestine.
And travelling merchants find their way to
such homes&mdash;bringing glass beads from Venice,
and little dainty mirrors, just now the vogue in that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
great City by the Sea; and velvet and filigree head-dresses,
and jewels and bits of tapestry from Flemish
cities. Perhaps a minstrel&mdash;if the revenues of
the family cannot retain one&mdash;will stroll up to the
castle-gates of an evening, giving foretaste of his
power by a merry snatch of song about Robin Hood,
or Sir Guy, or the Nut Brown Maid.</p>

<p>Some company of priests with a lordly abbot at
their head, journeying up from St. Albans, may stop
for a day, and kindle up with cheer the great hall,
which will be fresh strown with aromatic herbs for
the occasion; and so some solitary palmer, with
scollop shell, may make the evening short with his
story of travel across the desert; or&mdash;best of all&mdash;some
returning knight, long looked for&mdash;half
doubted&mdash;shall talk bravely of the splendors he
has seen in the luxurious court of Charles of Anjou,
where the chariot of his Queen was covered with
velvet sprinkled with lilies of gold, and men-at-arms
wore plumed helmets and jewelled collars; he may
sing, too, snatches of those tender madrigals of
Provence, and she&mdash;if Sister Nathalie has taught
her thereto&mdash;may join in a roundelay, and the minstrel
and harpist come clashing in to the <i lang="fr">refrain</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>Then there is the home embroidery&mdash;the hemming
of the robes, the trimming of the mantles,
the building up of the head pieces. Pray&mdash;in what
age and under what civilization&mdash;has a young woman
ever failed of showing zeal in those branches
of knowledge?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>So, we will leave England&mdash;to-day&mdash;upon the
stroke of thirteen hundred years. When we talk of
life there again, we shall come very swiftly upon
traces of one of her great philosophers, and of one
of her great reformers, and of one of her greatest
poets.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p class="dropcap">In our last chapter I spoke of that Geoffrey of
Monmouth who about the middle of the
twelfth century wrote a history&mdash;mostly apocryphal&mdash;in
which was imbedded a germ of the King Arthur
fables. We traced these fables, growing under
the successive touches of Wace and Map and Layamon
into full-fledged legends, repeated over and
over; and finally, with splendid affluence of color
appearing on the literary horizon of our own day.
I spoke of King Richard I. and of his song loving,
and of his blood loving, and of his royal frankness:
then of John, that renegade brother of his&mdash;of how
he granted <cite>Magna Charta</cite>, killed poor Prince Arthur,
and stirred such a current of war as caused the loss
of Normandy to England. I spoke of the connection
of this loss with the consolidation of the language;
of how Robert of Gloucester made a rhyming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
history that was in a new English; of how the
name of Sir John Mandeville was associated with
great lies, in the same tongue; how the religious
houses made books, and fattened on the best of the
land, and grew corrupt; and last&mdash;of how we, if we
had lived in those days, would have found disport
for our idle hours and consolation for our serious
ones.</p>

<h3>Roger Bacon.</h3>

<p>Starting now from about the same point in time
where we left off, our opening scene will take us to
the old University town of Oxford. It is a rare city
for a young American to visit; its beautiful High
Street, its quaint Colleges, its Christ Church Hall, its
libraries, its Magdalen walks and tower, its charming
gardens of St. John’s and Trinity, its near Park
of Blenheim, its fragrant memories&mdash;all, make it a
place where one would wish to go and long to linger.
But in the far-away time we speak of it was a
walled city, with narrow streets, and filthy lodging
houses; yet great parliaments had been held there;
the royal domain of Woodstock was near by with its
Palace; the nunnery was standing, where was educated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
the Fair Rosamund; a little farther away was
the great religious house of Abingdon and the village
of Cumnor; but of all its present august and
venerable array of colleges only one or two then existed&mdash;Merton,
and perhaps Balliol, or the University.<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>But the schools here had won a very great reputation
in the current of the thirteenth century,
largely through the scholarship and popularity of
Grosseteste, one while Bishop of Lincoln, who held
ministrations at Oxford by reason of his connection
with a Franciscan brotherhood established here;
and among those crop-haired Franciscans was a
monk&mdash;whom we have made this visit to Oxford to
find&mdash;named Roger Bacon. He had been not only
student but teacher there; and a few miles south
from the King’s Arms Hotel in Broad Street, Oxford,
is still standing a church tower, in the little
parish of Sunningwell, from which&mdash;as tradition
affirms&mdash;Roger Bacon studied the heavens: for he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
believed in Astrology, and believed too in the transmutation
of metals; and he got the name of magician,
and was cashiered and imprisoned twice or
thrice for this and other strange beliefs. But he
believed most of all in the full utterance of his beliefs,
and in experimenting, and in interrogating
nature, and distrusting conventionalisms, and in
search for himself into all the mysteries, whether of
nature or theology.</p>

<p>He had sprung from worthy and well-to-do parents
in the Western County of Somersetshire. He
had spent very much money for those days on his
education; had obtained a Doctorate at Paris; his
acuteness and his capacity for study were everywhere
recognized; he knew more of Greek than
most of his teachers, and more of Hebrew than most
of the Rabbis, and more of Chemistry and Physics
generally than probably any other man in England.
He took a Friar’s vows, as we have said; but these
did not save him from interdiction by the Chief of
his Order, by whom he was placed under ten years
of surveillance at Paris&mdash;his teachings silenced, and
he suffering almost to starvation. A liberal Pope
(for those days), Clement IV., by his intervention set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
free the philosopher’s pen again; and there came of
this freedom the <cite>Opus Majus</cite> by which he is most
worthily known. Subsequently he was permitted to
return to his old sphere of study in Oxford, where
he pursued afresh his scientific investigations, but
coupled with them such outspoken denunciations of
the vices and ignorance of his brother Friars, as to
provoke new condemnation and an imprisonment
that lasted for fourteen years&mdash;paying thus, in
this accredited mediæval way, for his freedom of
speech.</p>

<p>It is not improbable that we owe to him and to
his optical studies&mdash;in some humble degree&mdash;the
eye-glasses that make reading possible to old eyes:
and his books, first of any books from English
sources, described how sulphur and charcoal and
saltpetre properly combined will make thunder and
lightning (<i lang="la">sic facies tonitrum et coruscationem</i>). We
call the mixture gunpowder. In his <cite>Opus Majus</cite>
(he wrote only in Latin, and vastly more than has
appeared in printed form) scholars find some of the
seeds of the riper knowledges which came into
the <cite>Novum Organum</cite> of another and later Bacon&mdash;with
whom we must not confound this sharp,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
eager, determined, inquiring Franciscan friar. He
is worthy to be kept in mind as the Englishman
who above all others living in that turbid thirteenth
century, saw through the husks of things to their
very core.</p>

<p>He died at the close of the century&mdash;probably in
the year 1294; and I have gone back to that far-away
time&mdash;somewhat out of our forward track&mdash;and
have given you a glimpse of this Franciscan innovator
and wrestler with authorities, in order that I
might mate him with two other radical thinkers
whose period of activity belonged to the latter half
of the succeeding century: I mean Langlande and
Wyclif. And before we go on to speak of these
two, we will set up a few way-marks, so that we may
not lose our historic bearings in the drift of the intervening
years.</p>

<p>Bacon died, as we have said, in 1294. William
Wallace fought his great battle of Cambuskenneth
in 1297. Those who have read that old favorite of
school-boys, Miss Porter’s “Scottish Chiefs,” will
not need to have their memories refreshed about
William Wallace. Indeed, that hero will be apt to
loom too giant-like in their thought, and with a halo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
about him which I suspect sober history would
hardly justify. Wallace was executed at Smithfield
(Miss Porter says he died of grief before the axe
fell) in 1305; and that stout, flax-haired King Edward
I., who had humbled Scotland at Falkirk&mdash;who
was personally a match for the doughtiest of
his knights&mdash;who was pious (as the times went),
and had set up beautiful memorial crosses to his
good Queen Eleanor&mdash;who had revived King Arthur’s
Round Table at Kenilworth, died only two
years after he had cruelly planted the head of Wallace
on London Bridge. Then came the weak Edward
II., and the victories of Bruce of Bannockburn, and
that weary Piers Gaveston story, and the shocking
death of the King in Berkeley Castle. The visitor
to Berkeley (it is in Gloucestershire, and only two
miles away from station on the Midland Railway)
can still see the room where the murder was done:
and this Castle of Berkeley&mdash;strangely enough&mdash;has
been kept in repair, and inhabited continuously
from the twelfth century until now; its moat, its
keep, and its warders walks are all intact.</p>

<p>After this Edward II. came the great Edward III.&mdash;known
to us through Froissart and the Black<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
Prince<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> and Crécy and Poitiers, and by Windsor
Castle&mdash;which he built&mdash;and by Chaucer and Wyclif
and Langlande and Gower, who grew up while
he was king; known to us also in a worse way, for
outliving all his good qualities, and becoming in his
last days a peevish and tempestuous voluptuary.</p>

<p>Some few foreign way-marks I also give, that the
reader may have more distinctly in mind this great
historic epoch. Dante died in exile at Ravenna, six
years before Edward III. came to power. Boccaccio
was then a boy of fourteen, and Petrarch nine years
his elder. And on the year that Crécy was fought
and won&mdash;through the prowess of the Black Prince,
and when the Last of the Tribunes, as you see him in
Bulwer Lytton’s novel, was feeling his way to lordship
in Rome,&mdash;there was living somewhere in
Shropshire, a country-born, boy poet&mdash;not yet
ripened into utterance, but looking out with keen
eyes and soreness of heart upon the sufferings of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
poor country folk, and upon the wantonness of the
monks, and the extravagance of the rich, and the
hatefulness of the proud&mdash;all which was set forth
at a later day in the Vision of Piers Plowman.</p>

<h3>William Langlande.</h3>

<p>This was William Langlande<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> (or Langley, as others
call him), reputed author of the poem I have
named. It makes a little book&mdash;earliest, I think, of
all books written in English&mdash;which you will be
apt to find in a well-appointed private library of our
day. I won’t say that it is bought to read, so much
as to stand upon the shelves (so many books are) as
a good and sufficient type of old respectabilities.
Yet, for all this, it is reasonably readable; with
crabbed alliterative rhythm;&mdash;some Latin intermixed,
as if the writer had been a priest (as some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
allege); and such knowledge of life and of current
shortcomings among all sorts of people as showed
him to be a wide-awake and fearless observer. It is
in the form of an Allegory, Christian in its motive;
so that you might almost say that the author was an
immature and crude and yet sharper kind of John
Bunyan who would turn <em>Great-Heart</em> into a <em>Plowman</em>.
The nomenclature also brings to mind the
tinker of the Pilgrim’s Progress; there is a Sir <em>Do-Well</em>
and his daughter <em>Do-Better</em>: then there is <em>Sir
In-wit</em> with his sons <em>See-well</em> and <em>Say-well</em> and <em>Hear-well</em>,
and the doughtiest of them all&mdash;<em>Sir Work-well</em>.
We may, I think, as reasonably believe that Bunyan
hovered over this book, as that Milton took hints
from the picture of Pandemonium attributed to
Cædmon.</p>

<p>Langlande is a little mixed and raw oftentimes;
but he is full of shrewdness and of touches of a
rough and unwashed humor. There is little tenderness
of poetic feeling in his verse; and scarcely ever
does it rise to anything approaching stateliness; but
it keeps a good dog-trot jog, as of one who knew
what he was doing, and meant to do it. What he
meant was&mdash;to whip the vices of the priests and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
scourge the covetousness of the rich and of the men
in power. It is English all over; English<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> in the
homeliness of its language; he makes even Norman
words sound homely; English in spirit too; full of
good, hearty, grumbling humor&mdash;a sort of predated
and poetic kind of Protestantism. Plums
might be picked out of it for the decoration of a
good radical or agrarian speech of to-day.</p>

<p>Of his larger religious and political drift no extracts
will give one a proper idea; only a reading
from beginning to end will do this. One or two
snatches of his verse I give, to show his manner:</p>

<p>It is a savage picture; and as savagely true as was
ever drawn of Envy. Those who cultivated the elegancies
of letters, and delighted in the pretty rhyming-balance
of Romance verse, would hardly have
relished him; but the average thinker and worker
would and did. It is specially noteworthy that the
existing MSS. of this poem, of which there are very
many, are without expensive ornamentation by illuminated
initial letters, or otherwise, indicating
that its circulation was among those who did not
buy a book for its luxuries of “make-up,” but for
its pith. A new popularity came to the book after
printing was begun, and made it known to those
who sympathized with its protesting spirit;&mdash;most
of all when the monasteries went down and readers
saw how this old grumbler had prophesied truly&mdash;in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
saying “the Abbot of Abingdon and all his people
should get a knock from a king”&mdash;as they did;
and a hard one it was.</p>

<p>Langlande was born in the West, and had wandered
over the beautiful Malvern hills of Worcestershire
in his day but he went afterward to live in
London, which he knew from top to bottom; had a
wife there, “Kytte,” and a daughter, “Calote;”<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
shaved his head like a priest; was tall&mdash;so tall he
came to be called “Long Will.” He showed little
respect for fine dresses, though he saw them all; he
was in London when Chaucer was there and when
the greater poet was writing, and had higher-placed
friends than himself; but he never met him,&mdash;from
anything that appears; never met Wyclif either,
with whom he must have had very much thinking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
in common, and who also must have been in London
many a time when tall Will Langlande sidled
along Fenchurch Street, or Cornhill. Yet he is
worthy to be named with him as representing a
popular seam in that great drift of independent and
critical thought, which was to ripen into the Reformation.</p>

<h3>John Wyclif.</h3>

<p>In the year when gunpowder was first burned in
battle, and when Rienzi was trying to poise himself
with a good balance on the rocking shoulders of the
Roman people, John Wyclif, the great English reformer
and the first translator of the Bible, was just
turned of twenty and poring over his books, not improbably
in that Balliol College, Oxford&mdash;of which
in the ripeness of his age he was to become Master.</p>

<p>We know little of his early personal history, save
that he came from a beautiful Yorkshire valley in
the North of England, where the Tees, forming the
border line of the County of Durham, sweeps past
the little parish of Wyclif, and where a manor-house
of the same name&mdash;traditionally the birthplace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
of the Reformer&mdash;stands upon a lift of the
river hank. Its grounds stretch away to those
“Rokeby” woods, whose murmurs and shadows relieve
the dullest of the poems of Scott.</p>

<p>But there is no record of him thereabout: if indeed
he were born upon that lift of the Tees bank,
the proprietors thereof&mdash;who through many generations
were stanch Romanists&mdash;would have shown
no honor to the arch-heretic; and it is noteworthy
that within a chapel attached to the Wyclif manor-house,
mass was said and the Pope reverenced, down
to a very recent time. John Wyclif, in the great
crowd of his writings, whether English or Latin,
told no story of himself or of his young days. We
have only clear sight of him when he has reached
full manhood&mdash;when he has come to the mastership
of Balliol Hall, and to eloquent advocacy of the
rights and dignities of England, as against the Papal
demand for tribute. On this service he goes up to
London, and is heard there&mdash;maybe in Parliament;
certainly is heard with such approval that he is, only
a few years thereafter&mdash;sent with a commission, to
treat with ambassadors from the Pope, at the old
city of Bruges.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>This was a rich city&mdash;called the Venice of the
North&mdash;and princes and nobles from all Europe
were to be met there; its great town-house even
then lifted high into the air that Belfry of Bruges
which has become in our day the nestling-place of
song. But Wyclif was not overawed by any splendors
of scene or association. He insisted doggedly
upon the rights of Englishmen as against Papal pretensions.
John of Gaunt, a son of the king, stood
by Wyclif; not only befriending him there, but
afterward when Papish bulls were thundered against
him, and when he was summoned up to London&mdash;as
befell in due time&mdash;to answer for his misdeeds;
and when the populace, who had caught a liking for
the stalwart independence of the man, crowded
through the streets (tall Will Langlande very probably
among them), to stand between the Reformer
and the judges of the Church. He did not believe
in Ecclesiastic hierarchies; and it is quite certain
that he was as little liked by the abbots and the
bishops and the fat vicars, as by the Pope.</p>

<p>I have said he was befriended by John of Gaunt:
and this is a name which it is worth while for students
of English history to remember; not only because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
he was a brother of the famous Black Prince
(and a better man than he, though he did not fight
so many battles), but because he was also a good
friend of the poet Chaucer&mdash;as we shall find. It
will perhaps help one to keep him in mind, if I refer
to that glimpse we get of him in the early scenes
of Shakespeare’s tragedy of Richard II., where he
makes a play upon his name:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">O, how that name befits my composition!</div>
<div class="verse">Old Gaunt, indeed! and gaunt in being old.</div>
<div class="verse">Within me grief hath kept a tedious fast</div>
<div class="verse">And who abstains from meat, that is not gaunt?</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>A good effigy of this John, in his robes, is on the
glass of a window in All-Souls’ College, Oxford.</p>

<p>But such great friends, and Wyclif numbered the
widow of the Black Prince among them, could not
shield him entirely from Romish wrath, when he
began to call the Pope a “cut-purse;” and his arguments
were as scathing as his epithets, and had
more reason in them. He was compelled to forego
his teachings at Oxford, and came to new trials,<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
which&mdash;as traditions run&mdash;he wore an air of great
dignity; and old portraits show us a thin, tall figure&mdash;a
little bent with over-study; his features
sharp-cut, with lips full of firmness, a flowing
white beard and piercing eyes&mdash;glowing with the
faith that was in him. This was he who blocked
out the path along which England stumbled through
Lollardry quagmires, and where Huss, the Bohemian,
walked in after days with a clumsy, forward
tread, and which Luther in his later time put
all alight with his torch of flame.</p>

<p>The King&mdash;and it was one of the last good deeds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
of Edward III.&mdash;gave to the old man who was railed
at by Popes and bishops, a church living at Lutterworth,
a pleasant village in Leicestershire, upon a
branch of that Avon, which flows by Stratford
Church; and here the white-haired old man&mdash;some
five hundred years ago (1384) finished his life; and
here the sexton of the church will show one to-day
the gown in which he preached, and the pulpit in
which he stood.</p>

<p>Even now I have not spoken of those facts about
this early Reformer, which are best kept in memory,
and which make his name memorable in connection
with the literature of England. In the quiet of
Lutterworth he translated the Latin Bible (probably
not knowing well either Greek or Hebrew, as
very few did in that day); not doing all this work
himself, but specially looking after the Gospels, and
perhaps all of the New Testament.</p>

<p>The reader will, I think, be interested in a little
fragment of this work of his (from Matthew viii.).</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Sothely [verily] Jhesus seeynge many cumpanyes about
hym, bad <em>his disciplis</em> go ouer the watir. And oo [one] scribe
or <em>a man of lawe</em>, commynge to, saide to hym&mdash;Maistre, I

Forsothe Jhesus saide to hym, Sue thou me, and late dede

</div>

<p>It is surely not very hard reading;&mdash;still less so
in the form as revised by Purvey,<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> an old assistant
of his in the Parish of Lutterworth; and it made
the groundwork of an English sacred dialect, which
with its <em>Thees</em> and <em>Thous</em> and <em>Speaketh</em> and <em>Heareth</em>
and <em>Prayeth</em> has given its flavor to all succeeding
translations, and to all utterances of praise and
thanksgiving in every English pulpit.</p>

<p>Not only this, but Wyclif by his translation
opened an easy English pathway into the arcana of
sacred mysteries, which in all previous time&mdash;save
for exceptional parts, such as the paraphrase of
Cædmon, or the Ormulum, or the Psalter of Aldhelm
and other fragmentary Anglo-Saxon versions of
Scripture&mdash;had been veiled from the common
people in the dimness of an unknown tongue. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
from the date of Wyclif’s translation&mdash;forward, forever&mdash;whatever
man, rich or poor, could read an
English ordinance of the King, or a bye-law of a
British parish, could also&mdash;though he might be
driven to stealthy reading&mdash;spell his way back,
through the old aisles of Sacred History, where
Moses and the prophets held their place, and into
the valleys of Palestine, where Bethlehem lay, and
where Christ was hung upon the tree.</p>

<h3>Chaucer.</h3>

<p>Now we come to a Poet of these times; not a
poet by courtesy, not a small poet, but a real
and a great one. His name is Chaucer. You may
not read him; you may find his speech too old-fashioned
to please you; you may not easily get
through its meaning; but if you do, and come to
study him with any warmth, the more you study
him the more you will like him. And this&mdash;not
because there are curious and wonderful tales in his
verse to interest you; not because your passion will
be kindled by any extraordinary show of dramatic
power; but because his humor, and gentleness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
and grace of touch, and exquisite harmonies of language
will win upon you page by page, and story
by story.</p>

<p>He was born&mdash;probably in London&mdash;some time
during the second quarter of the fourteenth century;<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
and there is reason to believe that an early
home of his was in or near Thames Street, which
runs parallel with the river,&mdash;a region now built up
and overshadowed with close lines of tall and grimy
warehouses. But the boy Chaucer, living there five
hundred and more years ago, might have caught
between the timber houses glimpses of cultivated
fields lying on the Southwark shores; and if he had
wandered along Wallbrook to Cheapside, and thence
westerly by Newgate to Smithfield Common&mdash;where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
he may have watched tournaments that Froissart
watched, and Philippa, queen of Edward III., had
watched&mdash;he would have found open country; and
on quiet days would have heard the birds singing
there, and have seen green meadows lying on either
side the river Fleet&mdash;which river is now lost in
sewers, and is planted over with houses.</p>

<p>On Ludgate Hill, in that far-off time, rose the tall
and graceful spire of old St. Paul’s, and underneath
its roof was a vista of Gothic arches seven hundred
feet in length. The great monastery of the Templars&mdash;and
of the Knights of St. John&mdash;where we
go now to see that remnant of it, called the Temple
Church,&mdash;had, only shortly before, passed into the
keeping of the Lawyers; the Strand was like a
country road, with great country-houses and gardens
looking upon the water; Charing Cross was a
hamlet midway between the Temple and a parish
called Westminster, where a huge Abbey Church
stood by the river bank.</p>

<p>Some biographers have labored to show that
Chaucer was of high family&mdash;with titles in it. But
I think we care very little about this; one story,
now fully accredited, makes his father a vintner,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
or wine-dealer, with a coat-of-arms, showing upon
one half a red bar upon white, and upon the other
white on red; as if&mdash;hints old Thomas Fuller&mdash;’twas
dashed with red wine and white. This escutcheon
with its parti-colored bars may be seen in
the upper left corner of the portrait of Chaucer,
which hangs now in the picture-gallery at Oxford.
And&mdash;for that matter&mdash;it was not a bad thing to
be a vintner in that day; for we have record of one
of them who, in the year after the battle of Poitiers,
entertained at his house in the Vintry, Edward
King of England, John King of France, David King
of Scotland, and the King of Cyprus. And he not
only dined them, but won their money at play; and
afterward, in a very unking-like fashion&mdash;paid
back the money he had won.</p>

<p>Chaucer was a student in his young days; but
never&mdash;as old stories ran&mdash;at either Cambridge or
Oxford; indeed, there is no need that we place him
at one or the other. There were schools in London
in those times&mdash;at St. Paul’s and at Westminster&mdash;in
either of which he could have come by all the
scholarly epithets or allusions that appear in his earlier
poems; and for the culture that declares itself in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
his riper days, we know that he was more or less a
student all his life&mdash;loving books, and proud of his
fondness for them, and showing all up and down his
poems traces of his careful reading and of an observation
as close and as quick.</p>

<p>It is the poet’s very self, who, borne away in the
eagle’s clutch amongst the stars, gets this comment
from approving Jove<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Thou hearest neither that nor this,</div>
<div class="verse">For when thy labor all done is,</div>
<div class="verse">And hast made all thy reckiningës</div>
<div class="verse">In stead of rest and of new thingës,</div>
<div class="verse">Thou goest homë to thine house anon</div>
<div class="verse">And all so dombe as any stone,</div>
<div class="verse">Thou sittest at another bokë</div>
<div class="verse">Till fully dazed is thy lokë.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But though we speak of Chaucer as bookish and
scholarly, it must not be supposed that he aimed at,
or possessed the nice critical discernment, with respect
to the literary work of others, which we now
associate with highest scholarly attainments; it may
well happen that his bookish allusions are not always
“by the letter,” or that he may misquote, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
strain a point in interpretation. He lived before
the days of exegetical niceties. He is attracted by
large effects; he searches for what may kindle his
enthusiasms, and put him upon his own trail of
song. Books were nothing to him if they did not
bring illumination; where he could snatch that, he
burrowed&mdash;but always rather toward the light
than toward the depths. He makes honey out of
coarse flowers; not so sure always&mdash;nor much caring
to be sure&mdash;of the name and habitudes of the
plants he rifles. He stole not for the theft’s sake,
but for the honey’s sake; and he read not for
cumulation of special knowledges, but to fertilize
and quicken his own spontaneities.</p>

<p>Nor was this poet ever so shapen to close study,
but the woods or the birds or the flowers of a summery
day would take the bend from his back, and
straighten him for a march into the fields:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent5">&mdash;&mdash;There is gamë none,</div>
<div class="verse">That from my bookës maketh me to gone,</div>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>And swift upon this in that musical “Legende of
Good Women,” comes his rhythmical crowning of
the Daisy&mdash;never again, in virtue of his verse, to
be discrowned&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">These lines of his have given an everlasting perfume
to that odorless flower.</p>

<p>How it befell that this son of a vintner came first
to have close association with members of the royal
household&mdash;household of the great Edward III.&mdash;we
cannot tell; but it is certain that he did come
at an early day to have position in the establishment
of the King’s son, Prince Lionel, Duke of Clarence;
he was sometime valet, too, of Edward III., and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
other years a familiar <i lang="fr">protégé</i> of John of Gaunt&mdash;putting
his poet’s gloss upon courtly griefs and
love-makings.</p>

<p>It is certain, moreover, that in the immediate service
of either Prince or King, he went to the wars&mdash;as
every young man of high spirit in England
yearned to do, when war was so great a part of the
business of life, and when the Black Prince was galloping
in armor and in victory over the fields of
Guienne. But it was a bad excursion the poet hit
upon; he went when disaster attended the English
forces; he was taken prisoner, and though ransomed
shortly thereafter&mdash;as the record shows&mdash;it is uncertain
when he returned; uncertain if he did not
linger for years among the vineyards of France;
maybe writing there his translation of the famous
<cite>Roman de la Rose</cite><a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>&mdash;certainly loving this and other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
such, and growing by study of these Southern melodies
into graces of his own, to overlap and adorn
his Saxon sturdiness of speech.</p>

<p>There are recent continental critics<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> indeed, who
claim him as French, and as finding not only his
felicities of verse, but his impulse and his motives
among the lilies of France. He does love these
lilies of a surety; but I think he loves the English
daisies better, and that it is with a thoroughly English
spirit that he “powders” the meadows with
their red and white, and sets among them the green
blades of those island grasses, which flash upon his
“morwenyngs of Maie.” To these times may possibly
belong&mdash;if indeed Chaucer wrote it&mdash;“The
Court of Love.” Into the discussion of its authenticity
we do not enter; we run to cover under
an ignorance which is more blissful than the
wisdom that wearies itself with comparison of dates,
with laws of prosody, with journeyman-like estimate
of the tinklings of this or that spurt of rhyming
habit. If Chaucer did not write it, we lift our hat
to the unknown melodist&mdash;who can put the birds
in choir&mdash;and pass on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>When our poet does reappear in London, it is
not to tell any story of the war&mdash;of its hazards, or
of its triumphs. Indeed, it is remarkable that this
lissome poet, whose words like bangles shook out
all tunes to his step, and who lived in the very heart
of the days of Poitiers&mdash;when the doughty young
Black Prince kindled a martial furor that was like
the old crusade craze to follow <cite>Cœur de Lion</cite> to
battle&mdash;remarkable, I say, that Chaucer, living on
the high tide of war&mdash;living, too, in a court where
he must have met Froissart, that pet of the Queen,
who gloried in giving tongue to his enthusiasm
about the deeds of knighthood&mdash;wonderful, I say,
that Chaucer should not have brought into any of
his tales or rhymes the din and the alarums and the
seething passions of war. There are indeed glimpses
of fluttering pennons and of spear thrusts; maybe,
also, purple gouts of blood welling out from his
page; but these all have the unreal look of the tourney,
to which they mostly attach; he never scores
martial scenes with a dagger. For all that Crécy
or its smoking artillery had to do with his song, he
might have sung a century earlier, or he might have
sung a century later. Indeed, he does not seem to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
us a man of action, notwithstanding his court connection
and his somewhile official place;&mdash;not even
a man of loudly declared public policy, but always
the absorbed, introspective, painstaking, quiet observer,
to whom Nature in the gross, with its humanities
now kindled by wanton appetites, and now
lifted by reverence and love (with the everlasting
broidery of flowers and trees and sunshine), was always
alluring him from things accidental and of the
time&mdash;though it were time of royal Philip’s ruin,
or of a conquest of Aquitaine.</p>

<p>Yet withal, this Chaucer is in some sense a man
of the world and courtier. The “Boke of the
Duchesse” tells us this. And he can weave chaplets
for those who have gone through the smoke of battles&mdash;though
his own inclination may not lead him
thither. To a date not very remote from that which
belongs to the “Duchesse” must in all probability
be assigned that other well-known minor poem of
Chaucer’s, called the “Parlament of Foules.”<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
There are stories of his love-lornness in his young
days, and of marriage delayed and of marriage
made good&mdash;coming mostly from those who paint
large pictures with few pigments&mdash;and which are
exceeding hazy and indeterminate of outline: his
“Troilus and Cresseide” make us know that he
could go through the whole gamut of love, and
fawning and teasing and conquest and forgetting,
in lively earnest as well as fancy&mdash;if need
were.</p>

<p>We have better data and surer ground to go
upon when we come to score his official relations.
We know that when not very far advanced in age
(about 1370) he went to the continent on the King’s
service; accomplishing it so well&mdash;presumably&mdash;that
he is sent again, very shortly after, with a commission&mdash;his
journey calling him to Genoa and
Florence; Italy and the Mediterranean, then, probably
for the first time, with all their glamour of
old story, coming to his view. Some biographers
make out, from chance lines in his after-poems,
that he went over to Padua and saw Petrarch there,
and learned of him some stories, which he afterward
wrought into his garland of the Canterbury<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
Tales. Possibly;<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> but it was not an easy
journey over the mountains to Padua in those
days, even if Petrarch had been domiciled there,&mdash;which
is very doubtful; for the Italian poet, old
and feeble, passed most of the latter years of his life
at Arqua among the Euganean hills; and if Chaucer
had met him, Petrarch would have been more apt to
ask the man from far-away, murky England, about
his country and King and the Prince Lionel (dead
in those days), who only a few years before had
married, at Milan, a daughter of the Visconti&mdash;than
to bore him with a story at second hand (from Boccaccio)
about the patient Griselda.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>However this may be, it is agreed by nearly all
commentators, that by reason of his southward journeyings
and his after-familiarity with Italian literature
(if indeed this familiarity were not of earlier
date), that his own poetic outlook became greatly
widened, and he fell away, in large degree, from
his old imitative allegiance to the jingling measures
of France, and that pretty</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent8">“Maze of to and fro,</div>
<div class="verse">Where light-heeled numbers laugh and go.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Through all this time he is in receipt of favors
from the Government&mdash;sometimes in the shape of
direct pension&mdash;sometimes of an annual gift of
wine&mdash;sometimes in moneys for payment of his
costs of travel;&mdash;sometime, too, he has a money-getting
place in the Customs.</p>

<p>John of Gaunt continues his stalwart friend. Indeed
this Prince, late in life, and when he had
come to the title of Duke of Lancaster, married, in
third espousals, a certain Kate Swynford (<i lang="fr">née</i> Roet),
who, if much current tradition may be trusted, was
a sister of Chaucer’s wife; it was, to be sure, looked
upon by court people (for various reasons) as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
match beneath the Duke; and Froissart tells us
with a chirrupy air<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> of easy confidence (but there
is no mention of the poet) that the peeresses of the
court vowed they would have nothing to do with
the new Duchess of Lancaster&mdash;by which it may
be seen that fine ladies had then the same methods
of punishing social audacities which they have now.
The tradition has been given a new lease of life by
the memorial window which under rule of Dean Stanley
was set in Westminster Abbey;<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> and, however the
truth may be, Chaucer’s life-long familiarity in the
household of Lancaster is undoubted; and it is
every way likely that about the knee of the poet
may have frisked and played the little Hal. (b. 1367),
who came afterward to be King Henry IV. It is to
this monarch, newly come to the throne, that Chaucer
addresses&mdash;in his latter days, and with excellent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
effect&mdash;that little piquant snatch of verse<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> about
the lowness of his purse:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">I am so sorrie now that ye be light,</div>
<div class="verse">For certes, but ye make me heavy cheere,</div>
<div class="verse">Me were as lief be laid upon my bere</div>
<div class="verse">For which unto your mercie thus I crie</div>
<div class="verse">Be heavie againe, or ellës mote I die.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Yet he seems never to lose his good humor or his
sweet complacency; there is no carping; there is
no swearing that is in earnest. His whole character
we seem to see in that picture of him which his
friend Occleve painted; a miniature, to be sure, and
upon the cover of a MS. of Occleve’s poems; but it
is the best portrait of him we have. Looking at it&mdash;though
’tis only half length&mdash;you would say he
was what we call a dapper man; well-fed, for he
loved always the good things of life&mdash;“not drinkless
altogether, as I guess;” nor yet is it a bluff
English face; no beefiness; regular features&mdash;almost
feminine in fineness of contour&mdash;with light
beard upon upper lip and chin; smooth cheeks;
lips full (rosy red, they say, in the painting); eye<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
that is keen,<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> and with a sparkle of humor in it;
hands decorously kept; one holding a rosary, the
other pointing&mdash;and pointing as men point who
see what they point at, and make others see it too;
his hood, which seems a part of his woollen dress,
is picturesquely drawn about his head, revealing
only a streak of hair over his temple; you see it is
one who studies picturesqueness even in costume,
and to the trimming of his beard into a forked
shape;&mdash;no lint on his robe&mdash;you may be sure of
that;&mdash;no carelessness anywhere: dainty, delicate,
studious of effects, but with mirth and good nature
shimmering over his face. Yet no vagueness or
shakiness of purpose show their weak lines; and in
his jaw there is a certain staying power that kept
him firm and active and made him pile book upon
book in the new, sweet English tongue, which out
of the dialects of Essex and of the East of England
he had compounded, ordered, and perfected,
and made the pride of every man born to the inheritance
of that Island speech.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>And it is with such looks and such forces and
such a constitutional cheeriness, that this blithe poet
comes to the task of enchaining together his Canterbury
Tales, with their shrewd trappings of Prologue&mdash;his
best work, getting its last best touches
after he is fairly turned of middle age, if indeed
he were not already among the sixties. Is it not
wonderful&mdash;the distinctness with which we see,
after five hundred years have passed, those nine and
twenty pilgrims setting out on the sweet April day,
to travel down through the country highways and
meadows of Kent!</p>

<p>The fields are all green, “y-powdered with daisies;”
the birds are singing; the white blossoms are
beginning to show upon the hedge-rows. And the
Pilgrims, one and all, are so touched and colored by
his shrewdness and aptness of epithet that we see
them as plainly as if they had been cut out, figure
by figure, from the very middle of that far-away
century.</p>

all touched with those little, life-like strokes which
only genius can command, and which keep the
breath in those old Pilgrims to Canterbury, as if they
travelled there, between the blooming hedge rows,
on every sunshiny day of every succeeding spring.</p>

<p>I know that praise of these and of the way Chaucer
marshals them at the Tabard, and starts them
on their way, and makes them tell their stories,
is like praise of June or of sunshine. All poets and all
readers have spoken it ever since the morning they
set out upon their journeyings; and many an American<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
voyager of our day has found best illumination
for that pleasant jaunt through County Kent toward
the old towers of Canterbury in his recollections of
Chaucer’s Pilgrims. It is true that the poet’s wayside
marks are not close or strong; no more does a
meteor leave other track than the memory of its
brightness. We cannot fix of a surety upon the
“ale-stake” where the Pardoner did “byten on a
cake,” and there may be some doubt about the
“litel” town</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">which that y-cleped is, Bob-up-and-Down.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But there is no doubt at all about the old Watling
Road and Deptford, and the sight of Greenwich
Heights, which must have shown a lifted forest
away to their left; nor about Boughton Hill
(by Boughton-under-Blean), with its far-off view
of sea-water and of sails, and its nearer view
of the great cathedral dominating Canterbury
town. Up to the year 1874 the traveller might
have found a Tabard<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> tavern in Southwark, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
at about 1600 had replaced the old inn that Chaucer
knew; but it repeated the old quaintness, and
with its lumbering balconies and littered court and
droll signs, and its saggings and slants and smells,
carried one back delightfully to fourteenth-century
times. And in Canterbury, at the end of the two
or three days’<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> pilgrim journey, one can set foot in
very earnest upon the pavement these people from
the Tabard trod, under the cathedral arches&mdash;looking
after the tomb of the great Black Prince, and the
scene of the slaughter of Thomas à Becket. In that
quaint old town, too, are gables under which some
of these story-tellers of the Pilgrimage may have
lodged; and (mingling old tales with new) there are
latticed casements out of which Agnes Wickfield
may have looked, and sidewalks where David Copperfield
may have accommodated his boy-step to
the lounging pace of the always imminent Micawber.
Yet it is in the country outside and in scenes
the poet loved best, that the aroma of the Canterbury
Tales will be caught most surely; and it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
among those picturesque undulations of land which
lie a little westward of Harbledown&mdash;upon the
Rochester road, which winds among patches of
wood, and green stretches of grass and billowy hop-gardens,
that the lover of Chaucer will have most
distinctly in his ear the jingle of the “bridel” of the
Monk, and in his eye the scarlet hosen and the
wimple of the Wife of Bath.</p>

<p>Yet these Canterbury Tales convey something in
them and about them beside delicacies; the host,
who is master of ceremonies, throws mud at a grievous
rate, and with a vigorous and a dirty hand.
Boccaccio’s indecencies lose nothing of their quality
in the smirched rhyme of the Reeve’s tale;<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> the
Miller is not presentable in any decent company,
and the Wife of Bath is vulgar and unseemly. There
are others, to be sure, and enough, who have only
gracious and grateful speech put into their mouths;
and it is these we cherish. The stories, indeed,
which these pilgrims tell, are not much in themselves;
stolen, too, the most of them; stolen, just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
as Homer stole the current stories about Ajax and
Ulysses; just as Boccaccio stole from the <cite>Gesta
Romanorum</cite>; just as Shakespeare stole from the
Cymric fables about King Lear and Cymbeline. He
stole; but so did everyone who could get hold of a
good manuscript. Imagine&mdash;if all books were in
such form now, and MSS. as few and sparse as then,
what a range for enterprising authors! But Chaucer
stole nothing that he did not improve and make
his own by the beauties he added.</p>

<p>Take that old slight legend (everywhere current
in the north of England) of the little Christian boy,
who was murdered by Jews, because he sang songs
in honor of the Virgin; and who&mdash;after death&mdash;still
sang, and so discovered his murderers. It is a
bare rag of story, with only streaks of blood-red in
it; yet how tenderly touched, and how pathetically
told, in Chaucer’s tale of the Prioress!</p>

<p>It is a widow’s son&mdash;“sevene yeres of age”&mdash;and
wheresoe’er he saw the image</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Of Christe’s moder, had he in usage,</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>And the “litel” fellow, with his quick ear, hears at
school some day the <i lang="la">Alma Redemptoris</i> sung; and
he asks what the beautiful song may mean? He
says he will learn it before Christmas, that he may
say it to his “moder dere.” His fellows help him
word by word&mdash;line by line&mdash;till he gets it on his
tongue:</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>Through the Jews’ quarter he goes one day, singing
this sweet song that bubbles from him as he
walks; and they&mdash;set on by Satan, who “hath in
Jewe’s herte his waspës nest”&mdash;conspire and plot,
and lay hold on him, and cut his throat, and cast
him into a pit.</p>

<p>But&mdash;a wonder&mdash;a miracle!&mdash;still from the
bleeding throat, even when life is gone, comes the
tender song, “<i lang="la">O Alma Redemptoris!</i>” And the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>

<p>Then the Christian people take him up, and bear

<p>How tenderly the words all match to the delicate
meaning! This delightful poet knows every finest
resource of language: he subdues and trails after
him all its harmonies. No grimalkin stretching out
silken paws touches so lightly what he wants only
to touch; no cat with sharpest claws clings so tenaciously
to what he would grip with his earnester
words. He is a painter whose technique is never at
fault&mdash;whose art is an instinct.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>Yet&mdash;it must be said&mdash;there is no grand horizon
at the back of his pictures: pleasant May-mornings
and green meadows a plenty; pathetic episodes,
most beguiling tracery of incidents and of character,
but never strong, passionate outbursts showing profound
capacity for measurement of deepest emotion.
We cannot think of him as telling with any adequate
force the story of King Lear, in his delirium
of wrath: Macbeth’s stride and hushed madness
and bated breath could not come into the charming,
mellifluous rhythm of Chaucer’s most tragic
story without making a dissonance that would be
screaming.</p>

<p>But his descriptions of all country things are garden-sweet.
He touches the daisies and the roses
with tints that keep them always in freshest, virgin,
dewy bloom; and he fetches the forest to our eye
with words that are brim-full of the odors of the
woods and of the waving of green boughs.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In our next talk we shall speak of some who sang
beside him, and of some who followed; but of these
not one had so rare a language, and not one had
so true an eye.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p class="dropcap">In our last chapter we went back to the latter
edge of the thirteenth century and to the City
of Oxford, that we might find in that time and place
a Franciscan Friar&mdash;known as Roger Bacon, who
had an independence of spirit which brought him
into difficulties, and a searchingness of mind which
made people count him a magician. I spoke of
Langlande and Wyclif: and of how the reforming
spirit of the first expressed itself in the alliterative
rhythm of the Piers Plowman allegory; and how
the latter declared against Papal tyranny and the
accepted dogmas of the Church: he too, set on foot
those companies of “pore priests,” who in long russet
gowns reaching to their heels, and with staff in
hand, traversed the highways and byways of England,
preaching humility and charity; he gave to
us moreover that Scriptural quaintness of language,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
which from Wyclif’s time, down to ours, has left
its trail in every English pulpit, and colored every
English prayer.</p>

<p>Then we came to that great poet Chaucer, who
wrote so much and so well, as&mdash;first and most of
all contemporary or preceding writers&mdash;to make
one proud of the new English tongue. He died in
1400, and was buried at Westminster&mdash;not a stone’s
throw away from the site of his last London home.
His tomb, under its Gothic screen, may be found in
the Poet’s Corner of the Abbey, a little to the right,
on entering from the Old Palace Yard; and over it,
in a window that looks toward the Houses of Parliament,
has been set&mdash;in these latter years, in unfading
array&mdash;the gay company of Chaucer’s Canterbury
Pilgrims.</p>

<p>In the same year in which the poet died, died
also that handsome and unfortunate Richard the
Second<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> (son of the Black Prince) who promised
bravely; who seemed almost an heroic figure when
in his young days, he confronted Wat Tyler so
coolly; but he made promises he could not or would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
not keep&mdash;slipped into the enthralment of royalties
against which Lollard and democratic malcontents
bayed in vain: there were court cabals that overset
him; Shakespeare has told his story, and in that
tragedy&mdash;lighted with brilliant passages&mdash;John of
Gaunt, brother to the Black Prince, appears, old,
and gray and near his grave; and his son&mdash;the
crafty but resolute Henry Bolingbroke&mdash;comes on
the stage as Henry IV. to take the “brittle glory”
of the crown.</p>

<h3>Of Gower and Froissart.</h3>

<p>But I must not leave Chaucer’s immediate times,
without speaking of other men who belonged there:
the first is John Gower&mdash;a poet whom I name from
a sense of duty rather than from any special liking
for what he wrote. He was a man of learning for
those days&mdash;having a good estate too, and living in
an orderly Kentish home, to which he went back
and forth in an eight-oared barge upon the Thames.
He wrote a long Latin poem <cite>Vox Clamantis</cite>, in
which like Langlande he declaimed against the
vices and pretensions of the clergy; and he also
treated in the high-toned conservative way of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
well-to-do country gentleman, the social troubles of
the time, which had broken out into Wat Tyler and
Jack Straw rebellions;&mdash;people should be wise and
discreet and religious; then, such troubles would
not come.</p>

<p>A better known poem of Gower&mdash;because written
in English&mdash;was the <cite>Confessio Amantis</cite>: Old Classic,
and Romance tales come into it, and are fearfully
stretched out; and there are pedagogic Latin rubrics
at the margin, and wearisome repetitions, with now
and then faint scent of prettinesses stolen from
French <i lang="fr">fabliaux</i>: but unless your patience is heroic,
you will grow tired of him; and the monotonous,
measured, metallic jingle of his best verse is provokingly
like the “Caw-caw” of the prim, black
raven. He had art, he had learning, he had good-will;
but he could not weave words into the thrush-like
melodies of Chaucer. Even the clear and
beautiful type of the Bell &amp; Daldy edition<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> does
not make him entertaining. You will tire before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
you are half through the Prologue, which is as long,
and stiff as many a sermon. And if you skip to
the stories, they will not win you to liveliness: Pauline’s
grace, and mishaps are dull; and the sharp,
tragic twang about Gurmunde’s skull, and the vengeance
of Rosemunde (from the old legend which
Paul the Deacon tells) does not wake one’s blood.</p>

<p>In his later years he was religiously inclined;
was a patron and, for a time, resident of the Priory
which was attached to the church, now known as
St. Saviour’s, and standing opposite to the London
Bridge Station in Southwark. In that church
may now be found the tomb of Gower and his
effigy in stone, with his head resting on “the likeness
of three books which he compiled.”</p>

<p>Perhaps I have no right to speak of Froissart,
because he was a Fleming, and did not write in
English; but Lord Berners’ spirited translation of
his Chronicle (1523) has made it an English
classic:<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> moreover, Froissart was very much in
London; he was a great pet of the Queen of Edward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
III.; he had free range of the palace; he
described great fêtes that were given at Windsor,
and tournaments on what is now Cheapside; a
reporter of our day could not have described these
things better: he went into Scotland too&mdash;the
Queen Philippa giving him his outfit&mdash;and stayed
with the brave Douglas “much time,” and tells us
of Stirling and of Melrose Abbey. Indeed, he was
a great traveller. He was at Milan when Prince
Clarence of England married one of the great
Visconti (Chaucer possibly there also, and Petrarch
of a certainty); he was at Rome, at Florence,
at Bordeaux with the Black Prince, when his son
Richard II. was born; was long in the household of
Gaston de Foix: we are inclined to forget, as we
read him, that he was a priest, and had his parochial
charge somewhere along the low banks of the
Scheldt: in fact, we suspect that he forgot it himself.</p>

<p>He not only wrote Chronicles, but poems; and
he tells us, that on his last visit to England, he presented
a copy of these latter&mdash;beautifully illuminated,
engrossed by his own hand, bound in crimson
velvet, and embellished with silver clasps, bosses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
and golden roses&mdash;to King Richard II.; and the
King asked him what it was all about; and he said&mdash;“About
Love;” whereat, he says, the King seemed
much pleased, and dipped into it, here and there&mdash;for
“he could read French as well as speak it.”</p>

<p>Altogether, this rambling, and popular Froissart
was, in many points, what we should call an exquisite
fellow; knowing, and liking to know, only
knights and nobles, and flattering them to the full;
receiving kindly invitations wherever he went;
overcome with the pressure of his engagements;
going about in the latest fashion of doublet; somewhiles
leading a fine greyhound in leash, and presenting
five or six of the same to his friend the
Comte de Foix (who had a great love for dogs);
never going near enough to the front in battle to
get any very hard raps; ready with a song or a
story always; pulling a long bow with infinite
grace. Well&mdash;the pretty poems he thought so much
of, nobody knows&mdash;nobody cares for: they have
never, I think, been published in their entirety:<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
But, his Journal&mdash;his notes of what he saw and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
heard, clapped down night by night, in hostelries
or in tent&mdash;perhaps on horseback&mdash;are cherished
of all men, and must be reckoned the liveliest, if
not the best of all chronicles of his time. He died
in the first decade of that fifteenth century on
which we open our British march to-day; and, at
the outset, I call attention to a little nest of dates,
which from their lying so close together, can be
easily kept in mind. Richard II. son of the Black
Prince, died&mdash;a disgraced prisoner&mdash;in 1400. John
of Gaunt, his uncle, friend of Chaucer, died the
previous year: while Chaucer, Froissart and John
Gower all died in less than ten years thereafter;
thus, the century opens with a group of great
deaths.</p>

<h3>Two Henrys and Two Poets.</h3>

<p>That Henry IV. who appears now upon the
throne, and who was not a very noticeable man,
save for his kingship, you will remember as the
little son of John of Gaunt, who played about
Chaucer’s knee; you will remember him further<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
as giving title to a pair of Shakespeare’s plays, in
which appears for the first time that semi-historic
character&mdash;that enormous wallet of flesh, that egregious
villain, that man of a prodigious humor, all in
one&mdash;Jack Falstaff. And this famous, fat Knight
of Literature shall introduce us to Prince Hal who,
according to traditions (much doubted nowadays),
was a wild boy in his youth, and boon companion of
such as Falstaff; but, afterward, became the brave
and cruel, but steady and magnificent Henry V.
Yet we shall never forget those early days of his,
when at Gad’s Hill, he plots with Falstaff and his
fellows, to waylay travellers bound to London, with
plump purses. Before the plot is carried out, the
Prince agrees privately with Poins (one of the
rogues) to put a trick upon Falstaff: Poins and the
Prince will slip away in the dusk&mdash;let Falstaff and
his companions do the robbing; then, suddenly&mdash;disguised
in buckram suits&mdash;pounce on them and
seize the booty. This, the Prince and Poins do:
and at the first onset of these latter, the fat Knight
runs off, as fast as his great hulk will let him, and
goes spluttering and puffing to a near tavern, where&mdash;after
consuming “an intolerable deal of sack”&mdash;he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
is confronted by the Prince, who demands his
share of the spoils. But the big Knight blurts out&mdash;“A
plague on all cowards!” He has been beset, while
the Prince had sneaked away; the spoils are gone:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I am a rogue, if I was not at half a sword with a dozen
of them two hours together; I have scaped by a miracle; I
am eight times thrust thro’ the doublet&mdash;four thro’ the hose.
My sword is hacked like a hand-saw. If I fought not with
fifty of them, then am I a bunch of radish. If there were
not two or three and fifty on poor old Jack, then am I no
two-legged creature.”</p>

<p>“Pray God, [says the Prince, keeping down his laughter]
you have not murdered some of them!”</p>

<p><i>Falstaff.</i> Nay, that’s past praying for; for I peppered
two of them&mdash;two rogues in buckram. Here I lay, and thus
I bore my sword. Four rogues in buckram let drive at me.</p>

<p><i>Prince.</i> What, four?; thou said’st two.</p>

<p><i>Falstaff.</i> Four, Hal; I told thee four.</p>

</div>

<p>And Poins comes to his aid, with&mdash;“Ay, he said
four.” Whereat the fat Knight takes courage; the
men in buckram growing, in whimsical stretch to
seven, and nine; he, paltering and swearing, and
never losing his delicious insolent swagger, till at
last the Prince declares the truth, and makes show
of the booty. You think this coward Falstaff may
lose heart at this; not a whit of it; his eye, rolling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
in fat, does not blink even, while the Prince
unravels the story; but at the end the stout Knight
hitches up his waistband, smacks his lips:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“D’ye think I did not know ye, my masters? Should I
turn upon the true Prince? Why thou knowest I am as
valiant as Hercules; but beware instinct: I was a coward on
instinct.”</p>

</div>

<p>So runs the Shakespearean scene, of which I give
this glimpse only as a remembrancer of Henry IV.,
and his possibly wayward son.</p>

<p>If we keep by the strict letter of history, there is
little of literary interest in that short reign of his&mdash;only
fourteen years. Occleve, a poet of whom
I spoke as having painted a portrait of Chaucer
(which I tried to describe to you) is worth mentioning&mdash;were
it only for this. Lydgate,<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> of about
the same date, was a more fertile poet; wrote so
easily indeed, that he was tempted to write too
much. But he had the art of choosing taking subjects,
and so, was vastly popular. He had excellent
training, both English and Continental; he was a
priest, though sometimes a naughty one; and he
opened a school at his monastery of St. Edmunds.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
A few fragments of that monastery are still to be
seen in the ancient town of Bury St. Edmunds:&mdash;a
town you may remember in a profane way, as the
scene of certain nocturnal adventures that befel, in
our time, Mr. Pickwick and Sam Weller.</p>

<p>Notable amongst the minor poems of this old
Bury monk, is a jingling ballad called <cite>London
Lickpenny</cite>, in which a poor suitor pushing his way
into London courts, is hustled about, has his hood
stolen, wanders hither and yon, with stout cries of
“ripe strawberries” and “hot sheepes feete” shrilling
in his ears; is beset by taverners and thievish
thread-sellers, and is glad to get himself away again
into Kent, and there digest the broad, and ever
good moral that a man’s pennies get “licked” out
of him fast in London. Remembering that this
was at the very epoch when Nym and Bardolph frequented
the Boar’s Head, Eastcheap, and cracked
jokes and oaths with Dame Quickly and Doll Tearsheet,
and we are more grateful for the old rhyming
priest’s realistic bit of London sights, than for all
his classics,<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> or all his stories of the saints.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>But at the very time this Lydgate was writing, a
tenderer and sweeter voice was warbling music out
of a prison window at Windsor; and the music has
come down to us:<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

</div>
</div>

<p>There is a royal touch in that, and it comes from
a royal hand&mdash;that of Prince James of Scotland,
who, taken prisoner by Henry IV., was held fast for
sixteen years in the keep of Windsor Castle. Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
Irving has made him the subject of a very pleasant
paper in the Sketch-book. Though a prince, he
was a poet by nature, and from the window of his
prison did see the fair lady whose graces were garnered
in the verse I have cited; and oddly enough,
he did come to marry the subject of this very poem
(who was related to the royal house of England,
being grand-daughter of John of Gaunt) and thereafter
did come to be King of Scotland and&mdash;what
was a commoner fate&mdash;to be assassinated. That
queen of his, of whom the wooing had been so romantic
and left its record in the <cite>King’s Quair</cite>&mdash;made
a tender and devoted wife&mdash;threw herself at
last between him and the assassins&mdash;receiving grievous
wounds thereby, but all vainly&mdash;and the poor
poet-king was murdered in her presence at Perth,
in the year 1437.</p>

<p>These three poets I have named all plumed their
wings to make that great flight by which Chaucer
had swept into the Empyrean of Song: but not one
of them was equal to it: nor, thenceforward all
down through the century, did any man sing as
Chaucer had sung. There were poetasters; there
were rhyming chroniclers; and toward the end of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
the century there appeared a poet of more pretension,
but with few of the graces we find in the author
of the Canterbury Tales.</p>

<p>John Skelton<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> was his name: he too a priest living
in Norfolk. His rhymes, as he tells us himself,
were “ragged and jagged:” but worse than this,
they were often ribald and rabid&mdash;attacking with
fierceness Cardinal Wolsey&mdash;attacking his fellow-priests
too&mdash;so that he was compelled to leave his
living: but he somehow won a place afterward in the
royal household as tutor; and even the great Erasmus
(who had come over from the Low Countries,
and was one while teaching Greek at Cambridge)
congratulates some prince of the royal family upon
the great advantage they have in the services of such
a “special light and ornament of British literature.”
He is capricious, homely, never weak, often coarse,
always quaint. From out his curious trick-track of
verse, I pluck this little musical canzonet:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<h3>Henry V. and War Times.</h3>

<p>This fifteenth century&mdash;in no chink of which, as
would seem, could any brave or sweet English poem
find root-hold, was not a bald one in British annals.
There were great men of war in it: Henry V. and
Bedford<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> and Warwick and Talbot and Richard
III. all wrote bloody legends with their swords
across French plains, or across English meadows.</p>

<p>Normandy, which had slipped out of British
hands&mdash;as you remember&mdash;under King John, was
won again by the masterly blows Henry V. struck
at Agincourt and otherwheres. Shakespeare has
given an historic picture of this campaign, which
will be apt to outlive any contemporary chronicle.
Falstaff disappears from sight, and his old crony
the dissolute Prince Hal comes upon the scene as
the conquering and steady-going King.</p>

<p>Through all the drama&mdash;from the “proud hoofs”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
of the war-horses, prancing in the prologue, to the
last chorus, the lurid blaze of battle is threatening
or shining. Never were the pomp and circumstance
of war so contained within the pages of a
play. For ever so little space&mdash;in gaps of the reading&mdash;between
the vulgar wit of Nym, and the
Welsh jargon of Fluellen, you hear the crack of artillery,
and see shivered spears and tossing plumes.
In the mid scenes, vast ranks of men sweep under
your vision, and crash against opposing ranks, and
break, and dissolve away in the hot swirl of battle.
And by way of artistic contrast to all this, comes at
last, in the closing pages, that piquant, homely,
strange coquettish love-scene, which&mdash;historically
true in its main details&mdash;joined the fortunes of England
and of France in the persons of King Henry
and Katharine of Valois. You will not be sorry to
have a glimpse of this Shakespearean and historic
love-making: The decisive battle has been fought:
the French King is prisoner: Henry has the game
in his own hands. It is a condition of peace that
he and the fair Katharine&mdash;daughter of France&mdash;shall
join hands in marriage; and Henry in his
blunt war way sets about his wooing:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“O fair Katharine, if you will love me soundly with your
French heart, I will be glad to hear you confess it brokenly
with your English tongue. Do you like me, Kate?”</p>

<p><i>Kate.</i> <i lang="fr">Pardonnez moi</i>; I cannot tell vat is&mdash;<em>like me</em>.</p>

France?</p>

that I will not part with a village of it: I will have it all
mine: and, Kate, when France is mine, and I am yours, then
yours is France and you are mine. But, Kate, dost thou
understand thus much English&mdash;Can’st thou love me?</p>

<p><i>Kate.</i> I cannot tell.</p>

<p><i>King.</i> Can any of your neighbors tell, Kate?</p>

<p><i>Kate.</i> I do not know dat.</p>

<p><i>King.</i> By mine honor, in true English, I love thee,
Kate: by which honor, I dare not swear thou lovest me:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
yet my blood begins to flatter me, that thou dost. Wilt thou
have me Kate?</p>

<p><i>Kate.</i> That is as it shall please <i lang="fr">le roy mon Père</i>.</p>

<p><i>King.</i> Nay it will please him well, Kate. It <em>shall</em> please
him, Kate, and upon that, I kiss your hand and call you
“my Queen.”</p>

<p><i>Kate.</i> Dat is not de fashion <i lang="fr">pour les ladies</i> of France&mdash;to
kiss before marriage.</p>

<p><i>King.</i> O Kate, [loftily] <em>nice customs courtesy to great
Kings</em>:&mdash;here comes your father.</p>

</div>

<p>And these two <em>did</em> marry; the Queen being&mdash;as
Shakespeare represents&mdash;in a large sense, the spoil
of war. Out of this union sprung the next King,
Henry VI., crowned when an infant. But this does
not close the story of Katharine: three years after
the King’s death, she married a Welsh knight&mdash;named
Sir Owen Tudor. (He, poor man, lost his
head, some years after, for his temerity in marrying
a King’s widow.) But from the second marriage
of Katharine, was born a son who became
the father of that Henry VII., who sixty years later
conquered Richard III. on Bosworth field&mdash;brought
to an end the wars of York and Lancaster, and gave
his own surname of Tudor to his son Henry VIII.,
to the great Elizabeth and to bloody Mary.</p>

<p>Seeing thus how the name of Tudor came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
into the royal family, through that Katharine of
Valois, whose courtship is written in the play of
Henry V., I will try on the same page to fasten in
mind the cause of the great civil wars of York and
Lancaster, or of the white and red roses, which
desolated England in the heart of the fifteenth
century.<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>You will recall my having spoken of Chaucer as
a favorite in the household of John of Gaunt, and
as an inmate also in the household of John’s older
brother, Lionel. You will remember, too, that
Henry IV., son of John of Gaunt, succeeded the hapless
and handsome Richard II. on the throne; but
his right was disputed, and with a great deal of
reason, by the heirs of the older brother, Lionel
(who had title of Duke of Clarence). There was
not however power and courage enough to contest
the claim, until the kingship of young Henry VI.&mdash;crowned
when an infant&mdash;offered opportunity.
Thereafter and thereby came the broils, the apprehensions,
the doubts, the conspiracies, the battles,
which made England one of the worst of places to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
live in: all this bitterness between York and Lancaster
growing out of the rival claims of the heirs
of our old acquaintances Lionel and John of Gaunt,
whom we met in the days of Chaucer.</p>

<h3>Joan of Arc and Richard III.</h3>

<p>If we look for any literary illumination of this
period, we shall scarce find it, except we go again
to the historic plays of Shakespeare: The career of
Henry VI. supplies to him the groundwork for
three dramas: the first, dealing with the English
armies in France, which, after Henry V.’s death are
beaten back and forth by French forces, waked
to new bravery under the strange enthusiasm and
heroic leadership of Joan of Arc. Of course she
comes in for her picture in Shakespeare’s story: but
he gives us an ignoble one (though not so bad as
Voltaire’s in the ribald poem of <cite>La Pucelle</cite>).</p>

<p>No Englishman of that day, or of Shakespeare’s
day, could do justice to the fiery, Gallic courage,
the self-devotion, the religious ennoblement of that
earnest, gallant soul who was called the Maid of
Orleans. A far better notion of her presence and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
power than Shakespeare gave is brought to mind
by that recent French painting of Bastien-Lepage&mdash;so
well known by engraving&mdash;which aims to set
forth the vision and the voices that came to her
amid the forest silence and shadows. Amid those
shadows she stands&mdash;startled: a strong, sweet figure
of a peasant maiden; stoutly clad and simply;
capable of harvest-work with the strongest of her
sisterhood; yet not coarse; redeemed through
every fibre of body and soul by a light that shines
in her eye, looking dreamily upward; seeing things
others see not; hoping things others hope not, and
with clenched hand putting emphasis to the purpose&mdash;which
the hope and the vision kindle; pitying
her poor France, and nerved to help her&mdash;as
she did&mdash;all the weary and the troublesome days
through, till the shameful sacrifice at English
hands, on the market-place of Rouen, closed her
life and her story.</p>

<p>The two closing portions of the Henry VI. dramas
relate to home concerns. There is much blood
in them and tedium too (if one dare say this), and
flashes of wit&mdash;a crazy tangle of white and red roses
in that English garden&mdash;cleared up at last in Shakespeare’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
own way, when Richard III.<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> comes, in
drama of his own, and crookedness, and Satanry of
his own, and laughs his mocking laugh over the
corpses he makes of kings and queens and princes;
and at last in Bosworth field, upon the borders of
Warwickshire and near to the old Roman Watling
Street, the wicked hunchback, fighting like a
demon, goes down under the sword-thrust of that
Henry (VII.) of Richmond, who, as I have said, was
grandson to Katharine of Valois, of the coquettish
courtship.</p>

<p>No chronicler of them all, commonplace or painstaking
as he might be, has so planted the image of
the crooked Richard III. in men’s minds as Shakespeare:
though it is to be feared that he used somewhat
too much blood in the coloring; and doubtful if
the hump-backed king was quite the monster which
Garrick, Booth, and Macready have made of him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<h3>Caxton and First English Printing.</h3>

<p>In the midst of those draggling, dreary, dismal
war-times, when no poet lifted his voice in song,
when no chronicler who has a worthy name wrote
any story of the years, there came into vogue in
Europe and in England, a trade&mdash;which in its issues
had more to do with the life and spread of
good literature, than any poet, or any ten poets
could accomplish. You will guess at once what
the trade was; it was the trade of Printing.</p>

<p>Bosworth field dates in 1485: in the middle of
the century (or 1444) John Gutenberg began the
printing of a Bible; and a little after, Faust began
to dispose of wonderful copies of books, which the
royal buyers thought to be manuscripts: and Faust
did not perhaps undeceive them: yet copies were
so wonderfully alike&mdash;one to the other&mdash;that book
lovers were puzzled, and pushed inquiry, and so
the truth of the method came out.</p>

<p>In 1477 William Caxton set up the first English
printing press&mdash;in an old building, close upon Westminster
Abbey&mdash;a building, which, if tradition is
to be trusted, was standing down to near the middle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
of the present century; and on its demolition in
1846 its timbers were converted into snuff-boxes
and the like, as mementos of the first printer. It
was in 1477 that William Caxton issued the first
book, printed with a date, in England.<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>This Caxton was a man worth knowing about on
many counts: he was a typical Englishman, born
in Kent; was apprenticed to a well-to-do mercer in
the Old Jewry, London, at a time when, he says,
many poor were a-hungered for bread made of
fern roots;&mdash;he went over (while yet apprentice) to
the low countries of Flanders, perhaps to represent
his master’s interests; abode there; throve there;
came to be Governor of the Company of English
merchant adventurers, in the ancient town of
Bruges: knew the great, rich Flemings<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> who were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
patrons of letters;&mdash;became friend and protégé of
that English Princess Margaret who married Charles
Duke of Burgundy; did work in translating old
books for that great lady; studied the new printing
art, which had crept into Bruges, and finally, after
thirty odd years of life in the busy Flemish city
sailed away for London, and set up a press which
he had brought with him, under the shadow of
Westminster towers. Fifteen years and more he
wrought on there, at his printer’s craft&mdash;counting
up a hundred issues of books; making much of his
own copy, both translation and original, and dying
over seventy in 1492. A good tag to tie to this date
is&mdash;the Discovery of America; Columbus being
over seas on that early voyage of his, while the
first English printer lay dying.</p>

<p>And what were the books, pray, which Master
Caxton&mdash;who, for a wonder, was a shrewd business
man, as well as inclined to literary ways&mdash;thought
it worth his while to set before the world? Among
them we find <cite>A Sequell of the Historie of Troie</cite>&mdash;<cite>The
Dictes and Sayings of Philosophers</cite>&mdash;a history
of Jason, the <cite>Game and Plays of Chesse</cite>, Mallory’s
King Arthur (to which I have previously alluded),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
a <cite>Book of Courtesie</cite>, translations from Ovid, Virgil
and Cicero&mdash;also the Canterbury Tales of Chaucer
(of whom he was great admirer)&mdash;coupling with
these latter, poems by Lydgate and Gower; many
people in those days seeming to rank these men on
a level with Chaucer&mdash;just as we yoke writers together
now in newspaper mention, who will most
certainly be unyoked in the days that are to come.</p>

<p>The editions of the first English books ranged at
about two hundred copies: the type was what we
call black letter, of which four varieties were used
on the Caxton press, and the punctuation&mdash;if any&mdash;was
of the crudest. An occasional sample of his
work appears from time to time on the market even
now; but not at prices which are inviting to the
most of us. Thus in 1862, there was sold in England,
a little Latin tractate printed by Caxton&mdash;of
only ten leaves quarto, with twenty-four lines to the
page, for £200; and I observe upon the catalogue of
a recent date of Mr. Quaritch (the London bibliopole)
a copy of <cite>Godefroi de Bouloyne</cite>, of the Caxton
imprint, offered at the modest price of £1,000.</p>

<p>Very shortly after the planting of this first press
at Westminster, others were established at Oxford<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
and also at the great monastery of St. Albans.
Among the early books printed at this latter place&mdash;say
within ten years after Caxton’s first&mdash;was a
booklet written by a certain Dame Juliana Barnes;<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>
it is the first work we have encountered written
by a woman; and what do you think may have been
its subject? Religion&mdash;poesy&mdash;love&mdash;embroidery?
Not one of these; but some twenty odd pages
of crude verse “upon the maner of huntyng for all
maner of bestys” (men&mdash;not being included); and
she writes with the gusto and particularity of a man
proud of his falcons and his dogs. Warton says
blandly: “The barbarism of the times strongly appears
in the indelicate expressions which she often
uses; and which are equally incompatible with her
sex and profession.” The allusion to her “profession”
has reference to her supposed position as
prioress of a convent; this, however, is matter of
grave doubt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<h3>Old Private Letters.</h3>

<p>But this is not the only utterance of a female
voice which we hear from out those years of barrenness
and moil. In 1787 there appeared in England
a book made up of what were called Paston Letters<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>&mdash;published
and vouched for by an antiquarian
of Norfolk, who had the originals in his possession&mdash;and
which were in fact familiar letters that
had passed between the members and friends of a
well-to-do Norfolk family in the very years of the
War of the Roses, of Caxton, of King Richard, and
of Wynkyn de Worde.</p>

<p>Among the parties to these old letters, there is a
John Paston senior and a Sir John Paston, and a
John Paston the younger and a good Margery Paston;
there is a Sir John Fastolf too&mdash;as luck would
have it. Was this the prototype<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> of Shakespeare’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
man of humors? Probably not: nor can we say of
a certainty that he was the runaway warrior who
was of so bad repute for a time in the army of the
Duke of Bedford: but we do know from these musty
papers that he had a “Jacket of red velvet, bound
round the bottom with red leather,” and “Another
jacket of russet velvet lyned with blanket clothe;”
also “Two jackets of deer’s leather, with a collar of
black velvet,” and so on.</p>

<p>We do not however care so much about this Fastolf
inventory, as for what good Margaret Paston
may have to say: and as we read her letters we seem
to go back on her quaint language and her good
wifely fondness to the very days when they were
written&mdash;in the great country-house of Norfolk, near
upon the city of Norwich, with the gentle east wind
from the German Ocean, blowing over the Norfolk
fens, and over the forests, and over the orchards,
and over the barns, and into the hall-windows, and
lifting the very sheets of paper on which the good
dame Margery is writing. And what does she say?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ryte worshipful husband, I recommend me
unto you”&mdash;she begins; and thereafter goes on to
speak of a son who has been doing unwise things,
and been punished therefor as would seem:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“As for his demeaning, syn you departed, in good faith,
it hath been ryt good, I hope he will be well demeaned to
please you hereafterward; and I beseche you hartily that you
would vouchsafe to be hys good fader, for I hope he is chastyzèd,
and will be worthier. As for all oder tyngges at
home, I hope that I, and oder shall do our part therein, as
wel as we may; but as for mony it cometh in slowly, and
God hav you in his keeping, and sen you good speed in all
yr matters.”</p>

</div>

<p>Again, in another note, she addresses her husband,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Myn oune sweethert [a good many years after marriage
too!] in my most humble wyse I recommend me to you;
desiring hertly to her of your welfare, the which I beseche
Almighty God preserve and kepe.”</p>

</div>

<p>And a son writes to this same worthy Margaret:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Ryght worshipful and my moste kynde and tender
moder, I recommend me to you, thanking you of the great
coste, and of the grete chere that ye dyd me, and myn, at
my last being with you. <em>Item</em>: As for the books that weer
Sir James [would] it like you that I may have them? I am
not able to buy them; but somewhat wolde I give, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
remnant with a good devout hert, by my truthe, I will pray
for his soule.</p>

<p>“Also, moder, I herd while in London ther was a goodly
young woman to marry whyche was daughter to one Seff,
a mercer, and she will have 200 pounds in money to her
marriage, and 20 £ by year after the dysesse of a stepmoder
of hers, whiche is upon 50 yeeres of age: and fore I
departed out o’ Lunnon, I spak with some of the mayd’s
friends, and hav gotten their good wille to hav her married
to my broder Edmond. Master Pykenham too is another
that must be consulted&mdash;so he says: Wherefore, Moder, we
must beseeche you to helpe us forward with a lettyr to Master
Pykenham, for to remember him for to handyl this
matter, now, this Lent.”</p>

</div>

<p>A younger son writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I beseeche you humbly of your blessing: also, modyr,
I beseeche you that ther may be purveyed some meane that
I myth have sent me home by the same messenger that
shall bring my Aunt Poynings answer&mdash;two paire hose&mdash;1
payr blak and another russet, whyche be redy for me at
the hosers with the crooked back next to the Blk Friars gate,
within Ludgate. John Pampyng knoweth him well eno’.
And if the blk hose be paid for, he will send me the russet
ones unpaid for. I beseeche you that this geer be not forgot,
for I have not an whole hose to do on. I pray you visit
the Rood of St. Pauls, and St. Savior at Barmonsey whyls
ye abide in London, and let my sister Margery go with you to
pray to them that she may have a good husband ere she come
home again. Written at Norwich on holyrood day, by yr</p>

<p class="center">“Son and lowly Servant</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Jno: Paston the Youngest</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>This sounds as home-like as if it were written
yesterday, and about one of us&mdash;even to the sending
of two pair of hose if one was paid for. And
yet this familiar, boy-like letter was written in the
year 1465: six years before Caxton had set up
his press in Westminster&mdash;twenty-seven before
Columbus had landed on San Salvador, and at a
time when Louis XI. and barber Oliver (whose
characters are set forth in Scott’s story of Quentin
Durward) were hanging men who angered them
on the branches of the trees which grew around
the dismal palace of Plessis-les-Tours, in France.</p>

<h3>A Burst of Balladry.</h3>

<p>I have brought my readers through a waste literary
country to-day; but we cannot reach the oases
of bloom without going across the desert spaces.
In looking back upon this moil and turmoil&mdash;this
fret and wear and barrenness of the fifteenth century,
in which we have welcomed talk about Caxton’s
sorry translations, and the wheezing of his
press; and have given an ear to the hunting discourse
of Dame Juliana, for want of better things;
and have dwelt with a certain gleesomeness on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
homely Paston Letters, let us not forget that there
has been all the while, and running through all the
years of stagnation, a bright thread of balladry,
with glitter and with gayety of color. This ballad
music&mdash;whose first burst we can no more pin to a
date than we can the first singing of the birds&mdash;had
lightened, in that early century, the walk of the
wayfarer on all the paths of England; it had spun
its tales by bivouac fires in France; it had caught&mdash;as
in silken meshes&mdash;all the young foragers on
the ways of Romance. To this epoch, of which
we have talked, belongs most likely that brave ballad
of Chevy Chase, which keeps alive the memory
of Otterbourne, and of that woful hunting which</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Once there did, in Chevy Chase befal.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“To drive the deare with hounde and horne</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Erle Percy took his way;</div>
<div class="verse">The child may rue, that is unborn</div>
<div class="verse indent1">The hunting of that day.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Hereabout, too, belongs in all probability the
early English shaping of the jingling history of the
brave deeds of Sir Guy of Warwick; and some of
the tales of Robin Hood and his “pretty men all,”
which had been sung in wild and crude carols for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
a century or more, now seem to have taken on a
more regular ballad garniture, and certainly became
fixtures in type. This is specially averred
of “Robin Hood and the Monk,” beginning:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“In summer when the shawes be sheyne</div>
<div class="verse indent1">And levès be large and long,</div>
<div class="verse">Hit is full merry, in feyre forést,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">To here the foulé’s song;</div>
<div class="verse">To see the dere draw to the dale,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">And leve the hillés hee,</div>
<div class="verse">And shadow them in the levés green,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Under the grenwode tree.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But was Robin Hood a myth? Was he a real
yeoman&mdash;was he the Earl of Huntington? We
cannot tell; we know no one who can. We know
only that this hero of the folk-songs made the common
people’s ideal of a good fellow&mdash;brave, lusty&mdash;a
capital bowman, a wondrous wrestler, a lover
of good cheer, a hater of pompous churchmen, a
spoiler of the rich, a helper of the poor, with such
advices as these for Little John:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Loke ye do no housbande harme</div>
<div class="verse indent1">That tylleth with his plough;</div>
<div class="verse">No more ye shall no good yeman</div>
<div class="verse indent1">That walketh by grenewode shawe,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Ne no knyght, ne no squyèr,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">That wolde be a good felawe.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>That very charming ballad of the Nut-Brown
Maid must also have been well known to contemporaries
of Caxton: She is daughter of a Baron,
and her love has been won by a wayfarer, who says
he is “an outlaw,” and a banished man, a squire
of low degree. He tries her faith and constancy,
as poor Griselda’s was tried in Chaucer’s story&mdash;in
Boccaccio’s tale, and as men have tried and
teased women from the beginning of time. He
sets before her all the dangers and the taunts
that will come to her; she must forswear her
friends; she must go to the forest with him; she
must not be jealous of any other maiden lying
<i lang="fr">perdue</i> there; she must dare all, and brave all,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Or else&mdash;I to the greenwood go</div>
<div class="verse">Alone, a banished man.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>At last, having tormented her sufficiently, he confesses&mdash;that
he is not an outlaw&mdash;not a banished
man, but one who will give her wealth, and rank, and
name and fame. And I will close out our present
talk with a verselet or two from this rich old ballad.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>In our next chapter we shall enter upon a different
century, and encounter a different people.
We shall find a statelier king, whose name is more
familiar to you: In place of the fat knight and
Prince Hal, we shall meet brilliant churchmen and
hard-headed reformers; and in place of Otterbourne
and its balladry, we shall see the smoke
of Smithfield fires, and listen to the psalmody of
Sternhold.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>




<h2 id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</h2>

<p class="dropcap">When we turned the leaf upon the Balladry
of England, we were upon fifteenth century
ground, which, you will remember, we found
very barren of great writers. Gower and Froissart,
whom we touched upon, slipped off the stage just
as the century began&mdash;their names making two of
those joined in that group of deaths to which I called
attention, and which marked the meeting of two
centuries. Next we had glimpse of Lydgate and of
King James (of Scotland), who, at their best, only
gave faint token of the poetic spirit which illuminated
the far better verses of Chaucer.</p>

<p>We then passed over the period of the Henrys,
and of the War of the Roses, with mention of
Shakespeare’s Falstaff&mdash;of his Prince Hal&mdash;his
Agincourt&mdash;his courtship of Katharine of Valois&mdash;his
inadequate presentment of the Maid of Orleans&mdash;his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
crabbed and crooked Richard III.&mdash;all
rounded out with the battle of Bosworth field, and
the coming to power of Henry of Richmond.</p>

<p>We found the book-trade taking on a new phase
with Caxton’s press: we gave a tinkling bit of Skelton’s
“Merry Margaret;” we put a woman-writer&mdash;Dame
Juliana Barnes&mdash;for the first time on our
list; we lingered over the quaint time-stained Paston
Letters, which smelled so strongly of old English
home-life; and we summed up our talk with a
little bugle-note of that Balladry which made fitful
snatches of music all through the weariness of those
hundred years.</p>

<h3>Early Days of Henry VIII.</h3>

<p>To-day we front the sixteenth century. Great
names and great deeds crop out over it as thickly
as leaves grow in summer. At the very outset,
three powerful monarchs came almost abreast upon
the scene&mdash;Henry VIII. of England, Francis I. of
France, and Charles V. of Spain, Germany, and the
Low Countries.</p>

<p>Before the first quarter of the century had passed,
the monk Luther had pasted his ticket upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
doors of the church at Wittenberg; and that other
soldier-monk, Loyola, was astir with the beginnings
of Jesuitism. America had been planted; the Cape
of Good Hope was no longer the outpost of stormy
wastes of water with no shores beyond. St. Peter’s
church was a-building across the Tiber, and that
brilliant, courteous, vicious, learned Leo X. was
lording it in Rome. The Moors and their Saracen
faith had been driven out of the pleasant countries
that are watered by the Guadalquivir. Titian was
alive and working; and so was Michael Angelo and
Raphael, in the great art-centres of Italy: and Venice
was in this time so rich, so grand, so beautiful,
so abounding in princely houses, in pictures, in
books, in learning, and in all social splendors, that
to pass two winters in the City of the Lagoon, was
equal to the half of a polite education; and I suppose
that a Florentine or Venetian or Roman of that
day, thought of a pilgrimage to the far-away, murky
London, as Parisians think now of going to Chicago,
or Omaha, or San Francisco&mdash;excellent places,
with delightful people in them; but not the centres
about which the literary and art world goes spinning,
as a wheel goes spinning on its hub.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>We have in the contemporary notes of a well-known
Venetian chronicler, Marini Sanuto&mdash;who
was secretary to the famous Council of Ten&mdash;evidence
of the impression which was made on that
far-off centre of business and of learning, by such
an event as the accession of Henry VIII. to the
throne of England. This Sanuto was a man of
great dignity; and by virtue of his position in the
Council, heard all the “relations” of the ambassadors
of Venice; and hence his Diary is a great mine
of material for contemporary history.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“News have come,” he says, “through Rome of the death
of the King of England on April 20th [1509]. ’Twas known
in Lucca on the 6th May, by letters from the bankers Bonvisi.
The new King is nineteen years old, a worthy King,
and hostile to France. He is the son-in-law of the King of
Spain. His father was called Henry, and fifty odd years of
age; he was a very great <em>miser</em>, but a man of vast ability,
and had accumulated so much gold that he is supposed to
have [had] more than wellnigh all the other Kings of
Christendom. The King, his son, is liberal and handsome&mdash;the
friend of Venice, and the enemy of France. This
intelligence is <em>most</em> satisfactory.”</p>

</div>

<p>Certainly the new king was most liberal in his
spending, and as certainly was abundantly provided
for. And money counted in those days&mdash;as it does<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
most whiles: no man in England could come to the
dignity of Justice of the Peace&mdash;such office as our
evergreen friend Justice Shallow holds in Shakespeare&mdash;except
he had a rental of £20 per annum,
equivalent to a thousand dollars of present money&mdash;measured
by its purchasing power of wheat.<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> By
the same standard the average Earl had a revenue
of £20,000, and the richest of the peers is put down
at a probable income of three times this amount.</p>

<p>What a special favorite of the crown could do in
the way of expenditure is still made clear to us by
those famous walks, gardens, and gorgeous saloons
of Hampton Court, where the great Cardinal Wolsey
set his armorial bearings upon the wall&mdash;still to
be seen over the entrance of the Clock Court. If
you go there&mdash;and every American visitor in London
should be sure to find a way thither&mdash;you will see,
may be, in the lower range of windows, that look
upon the garden court&mdash;the pots of geranium and
the tabby cats belonging to gentlewomen of rank,
but of decayed fortune&mdash;humble pensioners of Victoria&mdash;who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
occupy the sunny rooms from which, in
the times we are talking of, the pampered servants
of the great Cardinal looked out. And when the
great man drove to court, or into the city, his retinue
of outriders and lackeys, and his golden trappings,
made a spectacle for all the street mongers.</p>

<p>Into that panorama, too, of the early days of
Henry VIII., enters with slow step, and with sad
speech, poor Katharine of Aragon&mdash;the first in order
of this stalwart king’s wives. Mrs. Fanny Kemble
Butler used to read that queen’s speech with a
pathos that brought all the sadnesses of that sad
court to life again: Miss Cushman, too, you may
possibly have heard giving utterance to the same
moving story; but, I think, with a masculinity about
her manner she could never wholly shake off, and
which gave the impression that she could&mdash;if need
were&mdash;give the stout king such a buffet on the ears
as would put an end to all chaffer about divorce.</p>

<p>Shakespeare, writing that play of Henry VIII.,
probably during the lifetime of Elizabeth (though
its precise date and full authenticity are matters of
doubt), could not speak with very much freedom of
the great queen’s father: She had too much of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
father’s spirit in her to permit that; otherwise, I
think the great dramatist would have given a blazing
score to the cruelty and <em>Bluebeardism</em> of Henry VIII.</p>

<p>I know that there be those acute historic inquirers
who would persuade us to believe that the king’s
much-marrying propensities were all in order, and
legitimate, and agreeable to English constitutional
sanction: but I know, too, that there is a strong
British current of common-sense setting down all
through the centuries which finds harbor in the
old-fashioned belief&mdash;that the king who, with six
successive wives of his own choice, divorced two,
and cut off the heads of other two, must have had&mdash;vicious
weaknesses. For my own part, I take a
high moral delight&mdash;Froude to the contrary&mdash;in
thinking of him as a clever, dishonest, good-natured,
obstinate, selfish, ambitious, tempestuous, arrogant
scoundrel. Yet, withal, he was a great favorite in
his young days;&mdash;so tall, so trim, so stout, so rich,
so free with his money. No wonder the stately and
disconsolate Queen (of Aragon) said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Would I had never trod this English earth,</div>
<div class="verse">Or felt the flatteries that grow upon it;</div>
<div class="verse">Ye’ve angels faces, but Heaven knows your hearts!”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>And this wilful King befriended learning and letters
in his own wilful way. Nay, he came to have
ambitions of his own in that direction, when he
grew too heavy for practice with the long-bow, or
for feats of riding&mdash;in which matters he had gained
eminence even amongst those trained to sports and
exercises of the field.</p>

<h3>Cardinal Wolsey and Sir Thomas More.</h3>

<p>It was with the King’s capricious furtherance
that Cardinal Wolsey became so august a friend of
learning. The annalists delight in telling us how
the great Cardinal went down to St. Paul’s School
to attend upon an exhibition of the boys there, who
set afoot a tragedy founded upon the story of Dido.
And at the boys’ school was then established as
head-master that famous William Lilly<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> who had
learned Greek in his voyaging into Eastern seas,
and was among the first to teach it in England: he
was the author too of that <cite>Lilly’s Latin Grammar</cite><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
which was in use for centuries, and of which later
editions are hanging about now in old New England
garrets, from whose mouldy pages our grandfathers
learned to decline their <i lang="la">pennæ&mdash;pennarum</i>.
Wolsey wrote a preface for one of the earlier issues
of this Lilly’s Grammar; and the King gave it a
capital advertisement by proclaiming it illegal to
use any other. The Cardinal, moreover, in later
years established a famous school at his native place
of Ipswich (a rival in its day to that of Eton), and
he issued an address to all the schoolmasters of
England in favor of accomplishing the boys submitted
to their charge in the most elegant literatures.</p>

<p>The great Hall of Christ’s Church College, Oxford,
still further serves to keep in mind the memory
and the munificence of Cardinal Wolsey: it
must be remembered, however, in estimating his
munificence that he had only to confiscate the revenues
of a small monastery to make himself full-pocketed
for the endowment of a college. ’Tis
certain that he loved learning, and that he did
much for its development in the season of his
greatest power and influence; certain, too, that his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
ambitions were too large for the wary King, his
master, and brought him to that dismal fall from
his high estate, which is pathetically set forth in
Shakespeare’s Henry VIII.:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent5">“&mdash;&mdash;Farewell to all my greatness!</div>
<div class="verse">This is the state of man: to-day he puts forth</div>
<div class="verse">The tender leaves of hope, to-morrow blossoms</div>
<div class="verse">And bears his blushing honors thick upon him;</div>
<div class="verse">The third day comes a frost&mdash;a killing frost;</div>
<div class="verse">And&mdash;when he thinks, good easy man, full surely</div>
<div class="verse">His greatness is a ripening&mdash;nips his root</div>
<div class="verse">And then he falls as I do. I have ventured,</div>

<div class="verse">Weary, and old with service, to the mercy</div>
<div class="verse">Of a rude stream that must forever hide me.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Another favorite of Henry in the early days
of his kingship, and one bearing a far more important
name in the literary annals of England than
that of Wolsey, was Sir Thomas More. He was a
Greek of the very Greeks, in both character and
attainment. Born in the heart of London&mdash;in
Milk Street, now just outside of the din and roar
of Cheapside, he was a scholar of Oxford, and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
the son of a knight, who, like Sir Thomas himself,
had a reputation for shrewd sayings&mdash;of which the
old chronicler, William Camden,<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> has reported this
sample:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Marriage,” said the elder More, “with its chances, is
like dipping one’s hand into a bag, with a great many
snakes therein, and but one eel; the which most serviceable
and comfortable eel might possibly be seized upon; but
the chances are largely in favor of catching a stinging
snake:”</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">But, says the chronicler&mdash;this good knight did himself
thrust <em>his</em> hand three several times into such
a bag, and with such ensuing results as preserved
him hale and sound to the age of ninety or thereabout.
The son inherited this tendency to whimsical
speech, joining with it rare merits as a scholar:
and it used to be said of him as a boy, that he could
thrust himself into the acting of a Latin comedy
and extemporize his part, with such wit and aptness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
as not to break upon the drift of the play.
He studied, as I said, at Oxford; and afterward
Law at Lincoln’s Inn; was onewhile strongly inclined
to the Church, and under influence of a
patron who was a Church dignitary became zealous
Religionist, and took to wearing in penance a bristling
hair-shirt&mdash;which (or one like it) he kept wearing
till prison-days and the scaffold overtook him,
as they overtook so many of the quondam friends
of Henry VIII. For he had been early presented
to that monarch&mdash;even before Henry had come to
the throne&mdash;and had charmed him by his humor
and his scholarly talk: so that when More came to
live upon his little farm at Chelsea (very near to
Cheyne Row where Carlyle died but a few years
since) the King found his way thither on more than
one occasion; and there are stories of his pacing up
and down the garden walks in familiar talk with the
master.</p>

<p>There, too, came for longer stay, and for longer
and friendlier communings, the great and scholarly
Erasmus (afterward teacher of Greek at Cambridge)&mdash;and
out of one of these visitations to
Chelsea grew the conception and the working out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
of his famous Praise of Folly, with its punning
title&mdash;<cite>Encomium Moriæ</cite>.<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<p>The King promised preferment to More&mdash;which
came in its time. I think he was in Flanders on
the King’s business, when upon a certain day, as he
was coming out from the Antwerp Cathedral, he encountered
a stranger, with long beard and sunburnt
face&mdash;a man of the “Ancient Mariner” stamp,
who had made long voyages with that Amerigo Vespucci
who stole the honor of naming America: and
this long-bearded mariner told Sir Thomas More of
the strange things he had seen in a country farther
off than America, called <cite>Utopia</cite>. Of course, it is something
doubtful if More ever really encountered such
a mariner, or if he did not contrive him only as a
good frontispiece for his political fiction. This is
the work by which More is best known (through its
English translations); and it has given the word
Utopian to our every-day speech. The present
popular significance of this term will give you a
proper hint of the character of the book: it is an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
elaborate and whimsical and yet statesmanlike forecast
of a government too good and honest and wise
to be sound and true and real.</p>

<p>Sir Thomas smacked the humor of the thing,
in giving the name <cite>Utopia</cite>, which is Greek for <em>Nowhere</em>.
If, indeed, men were all honest, and women
all virtuous and children all rosy and helpful,
we might all live in a Utopia of our own. All the
Fourierites&mdash;the Socialists&mdash;the Knights of Labor
might find the germs of their best arguments in
this reservoir of the ideal maxims of statecraft.
In this model country, gold was held in large disrespect;
and to keep the scorn of it wholesome, it
was put to the vilest uses: a great criminal was
compelled to wear gold rings in his ears: chains
were made of it for those in bondage; and a particularly
obnoxious character put to the wearing of a
gold head-band; so too diamonds and pearls were
given over to the decoration of infants; and these,
with other baby accoutrements, they flung aside in
disgust, so soon as they came to sturdy childhood.
When therefore upon a time, Ambassadors came to
Utopia, from a strange country, with their tricksy
show of gold and jewels&mdash;the old Voyager says:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“You shᵈ have sene [Utopian] children that had caste
away their peerles and pretious stones, when they sawe the
like sticking upon the Ambassadours cappes;&mdash;digge and
pushe theire mothers under the sides, sainge thus to them,&mdash;‘Loke
mother how great a lubbor doth yet were peerles,
as though he were a litel child stil!’ ‘Peace sone,’ saith
she; ‘I thinke he be some of the Ambassadours fooles.’”</p>

</div>

<p>Also in this model state industrial education was
in vogue; children all, of whatsoever parentage,
were to be taught some craft&mdash;as “masonrie or
smith’s craft, or the carpenter’s science.” Unlawful
games were decried&mdash;such as “dyce, cardes, tennis,
coytes [quoits]&mdash;do not all these,” says the author,
“sende the haunters of them streyghte a stealynge,
when theyr money is gone?”</p>

<p>The Russian Count Tolstoi’s opinion that money
is an invention of Satan and should be abolished, is
set forth with more humor and at least equal logic,
in this Latin tractate of More’s.</p>

<p>In the matters of Religion King Utopus decreed
that</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“it should be lawful for everie man to favoure and folow
what religion he would, and that he mighte do the best he
could to bring other to his opinion, so that he did it peaceablie,
gentelie, quietlie and sobelie, without hastie and contentious
rebuking.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>Yet this same self-contained Sir Thomas More did
in his after controversies with Tyndale use such
talk of him&mdash;about his “whyning and biting and
licking and tumbling in the myre,” and “rubbing
himself in puddles of dirt,”&mdash;as were like anything
but the courtesies of Utopia. Indeed it is
to be feared that theologic discussion does not
greatly provoke gentleness of speech, in any time;
it is a very grindstone to put men’s wits to sharpened
edges. But More was a most honest man
withal;&mdash;fearless in advocacy of his own opinions;
eloquent, self-sacrificing&mdash;a tender father and
husband&mdash;master of a rich English speech (his
<cite>Utopia</cite> was written in Latin, but translated many
times into English, and most languages of Continental
Europe), learned in the classics&mdash;a man
to be remembered as one of the greatest of Henry
VIII.’s time; a Romanist, at a date when honestest
men doubted if it were worthiest to be a King’s man
or a Pope’s man;&mdash;not yielding to his royal master
in points of religious scruple, and with a lofty obstinacy
in what he counted well doing, going to the
scaffold, with as serene a step as he had ever put to

<h3>Cranmer, Latimer, Knox, and Others.</h3>

<p>A much nobler figure is this, to my mind, than
that of Cranmer,<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> who appears in such picturesque
lights in the drama of Henry VIII.&mdash;who gave adhesion
to royal wishes for divorce upon divorce;
who always colored his religious allegiances with
the colors of the King; who was a scholar indeed&mdash;learned,
eloquent; who wrought well, as it
proved, for the reformed faith; but who wilted
under the fierce heats of trial; would have sought
the good will of the blood-thirsty Mary; but who
gave even to his subserviencies a half-tone that
brought distrust, and so&mdash;finally&mdash;the fate of that
quasi-martyrdom which has redeemed his memory.</p>

<p>He stands very grandly in his robes upon the
memorial cross at Oxford: and he has an even more
august presence in the final scene of Shakespeare’s
play, where amidst all churchly and courtly pomp,
he christened the infant&mdash;who was to become the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
Royal Elizabeth, and says to the assembled dignitaries:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent13">“This royal infant</div>
<div class="verse">Tho’ in her cradle, yet now promises</div>
<div class="verse">Upon this land a thousand thousand blessings,</div>
<div class="verse">Which time will bring to ripeness: She shall be</div>
<div class="verse">A pattern to all princes living with her,</div>
<div class="verse">And all that shall succeed her. Truth shall nurse her,</div>
<div class="verse">Holy and heavenly thoughts still counsel her:</div>
<div class="verse">She shall be loved and feared.</div>
<div class="verse">A most unspotted lily shall she pass</div>
<div class="verse">To the ground, and all the world shall mourn her.”<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Tennyson, in his drama of Queen Mary (a most
unfortunate choice of heroine) gives a statuesque
pose to this same Archbishop Cranmer; but Shakespeare’s
figures are hard to duplicate. He was
with Henry VIII. as counsellor at his death; was
intimate adviser of the succeeding Edward VI.:
and took upon himself obligations from that King<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
(contrary to his promises to Henry) which brought
him to grief under Queen Mary. That brave thrust
of his offending hand into the blaze that consumed
him, cannot make us forget his weaknesses and
his recantations; nor will we any more forget that
he it was, who gave (1543) to the old Latin Liturgy
of the Church that noble, English rhythmic
flow which so largely belongs to it to-day.</p>

<p>It is quite impossible to consider the literary aspects
of the period of English history covered by
the reign of Henry VIII., and the short reigns of
the two succeeding monarchs, Edward VI. and
Mary, without giving large frontage to the Reformers
and religious controversialists. Every scholar
was alive to the great battle in the Church. The
Greek and Classicism of the Universities came to
have their largest practical significance in connection
with the settlement of religious questions or in
furnishing weapons for the ecclesiastic controversies
of the day. The voices of the poets&mdash;the Skeltons,
the Sackvilles, the Wyatts, were chirping sparrows’
voices beside that din with which Luther thundered
in Germany, and Henry VIII. thundered back, more
weakly, from his stand-point of Anglicanism.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>We have seen Wolsey in his garniture of gold,
going from court to school; and Sir Thomas More,
stern, strong, and unyielding; and Archbishop
Cranmer, disposed to think rightly, but without the
courage to back up his thought; and associated
with these, it were well to keep in mind the other
figures of the great religious processional. There
was William Tyndale, native of Gloucestershire, a
slight, thin figure of a man; honest to the core;
well-taught; getting dignities he never sought;
wearied in his heart of hearts by the flattering
coquetries of the King; perfecting the work of
Wyclif in making the old home Bible readable by
all the world. His translation was first printed
in Wittenberg about 1530:<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> I give the Lord’s
Prayer as it appeared in the original edition:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Oure Father which arte in heven, halowed be thy name.
Let thy kingdom come. Thy wyll be fulfilled, as well in
erth, as hit ys in heven. Geve vs this daye oure dayly
breade. And forgeve vs oure trespases, even as we forgeve
them which treespas vs. Leade vs not into temptacion but
delyvre vs from yvell. Amen.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>But Tyndale was not safe in England; nor yet in
the Low Countries whither he went, and where the
long reach of religious hate and jealousy put its
hand upon him and brought him to a death whose
fiery ignominies are put out of sight by the lustrous
quality of his deservings.</p>

<p>I see too amongst those great, dim figures, that
speak in Scriptural tones, the form of Hugh Latimer,
as he stands to-day on the Memorial Cross in
Oxford. I think of him too&mdash;in humbler dress than
that which the sculptor has put on him&mdash;even the
yeoman’s clothes, which he wore upon his father’s
farm, in the Valley of the Soar, when he wrought
there in the meadows, and drank in humility of
thought, and manly independence under the skies
of Leicestershire<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>&mdash;where (as he says), “My father
had walk for an hundred sheep, and my mother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
milked thirty kine.” He kept his head upon his
shoulders through Henry’s time&mdash;his amazing wit
and humor helping him to security;&mdash;was in fair
favor with Edward; but under Mary, walked coolly
with Ridley to the stake, where the fires were set,
to burn them both in Oxford.</p>

<p>Foxe<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> too is to be remembered for his Stories
of the Martyrs of these, and other times, which
have formed the nightmare reading for so many
school-boys.</p>

<p>I see, too, another figure that will not down in
this coterie of Reformers, and that makes itself
heard from beyond the Tweed. This is John Knox,<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>
a near contemporary though something younger
than most I have named, and not ripening to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
greatest power till Henry VIII. had gone. Born of
humble parentage in Scotland in the early quarter
of the century, he was a rigid Papist in his young
days, but a more rigid Reformer afterward; much
time a prisoner; passing years at Geneva; not altogether
a “gloomy, shrinking, fanatic,” but keeping,
says Carlyle, “a pipe of Bordeaux in that old
Edinboro house of his;” getting to know Cranmer,
and the rest in England; discussing with these,
changes of Church Service; counselling austerities,
where Cranmer admitted laxities; afraid of no man,
neither woman;&mdash;publishing in exile in Mary’s day&mdash;<cite>The
first Blaste of the Trumpet against the monstrous
Regiment of Women</cite>, and repenting this&mdash;quietly no
doubt&mdash;when Elizabeth came to power. A thin, frail
man; strong no ways, but in courage, and in brain;
with broad brows&mdash;black cap&mdash;locks floating gray
from under it, in careless whirls that shook as he
talked; an eye like a falcon’s that flashed the light of
twenty years, when sixty were on his shoulders; in
after years, writhing with rheumatic pains&mdash;crawling
upon his stick and a servant’s arm into his
Church of St. Andrews; lifted into his pulpit by
the clerk and his attendant&mdash;leaning there on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
desk, a wilted heap of humanity&mdash;panting, shaking,
quivering&mdash;till his breath came, and the psalm and
the lifted prayer gave courage; then&mdash;fierce torrents
of speech (and a pounding of the pulpit till
it seemed that it would fly in shivers), with a sharp,
swift, piercing utterance that pricked ears as it
pricked consciences, and made the roof-timbers
clang with echoes.</p>

<p>Of all these men there are no books that take
high rank in Literature proper&mdash;unless we except
the <cite>Utopia</cite> of More, and the New Testament of
Tyndale: but their lives and thought were welded
by stout blows into the intellectual texture of the
century and are not to be forgotten.</p>

<h3>Verse-Writing and Psalmodies.</h3>

<p>And now, was there really no dalliance with the
Muses in times that brought to the front such
fighting Gospellers as we have talked of?</p>

<p>Yes, even Thomas More did write poems&mdash;having
humor in them and grammatic proprieties, and
his Latin prosody is admired of Classicists: then
there were the versifiers of the Psalms, Sternhold
and Hopkins, and the Whittingham who succeeded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
John Knox at Geneva&mdash;sharing that Scotchman’s
distaste for beautiful rubrics, and we suspect beautiful
verses also&mdash;if we may judge by his version of
the Creed. This is a sample:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“The Father, God is; God, the Son;</div>
<div class="verse indent1">God&mdash;Holy Ghost also;</div>
<div class="verse">Yet are not three gods in all</div>
<div class="verse indent1">But one God and no mo.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>From the Apostles’ Creed again, we excerpt
this:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“From thence, shall he come for to judge</div>
<div class="verse indent1">All men both dead and quick.</div>
<div class="verse">I, in the Holy Ghost believe</div>
<div class="verse indent1">And Church thats Catholick.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Hopkins,<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> who was a schoolmaster of Suffolk, and
the more immediate associate of Sternhold, thus expostulates
with the Deity:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Why doost withdraw thy hand aback</div>
<div class="verse indent1">And hide it in thy lappe?</div>
<div class="verse">Oh, plucke it out, and be not slacke</div>
<div class="verse indent1">To give thy foes a rap!”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>As something worthier from these old psalmists’
versing, I give this of Sternhold’s:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div>
</div>

<p>It may well be that bluff King Harry relished
more the homely Saxonism of such psalms than the
<cite>Stabat Maters</cite> and <cite>Te Deums</cite> and <cite>Jubilates</cite>, which
assuredly would have better pleased the Princess
Katharine of Aragon. Yet even at a time when the
writers of such psalmodies received small crumbs
of favor from the Court, the English Bible was by
no means a free-goer into all companies.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“A nobleman or gentleman may read it”&mdash;(I quote from a
Statute of Henry VIII.’s time)&mdash;“in his house, or in his garden,
or orchard, yet quietly and without disturbance of order.
A merchant may read it to himself privately: But the common
people, women, artificers, apprentices, journeymen and
servingmen, are to be punished with one month’s imprisonment,
as often as they are detected in reading the Bible,
either privately or openly.”<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p>Truly this English realm was a strange one in
those times, and this a strange King&mdash;who has
listened approvingly to Hugh Latimer’s sermons&mdash;who
harries Tyndale as he had harried Tyndale’s enemy&mdash;More;
who fights the Pope, fights Luther,
holds the new Bible (even Cranmer’s) in leash, who
gives pension to Sternhold, works easy riddance of
all the wives he wishes, pulls down Religious
Houses for spoils, calls himself Defender of the
Faith, and maybe goes to see (if then on show)
<cite>Gammer Gurton’s Needle</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> and is hilariously responsive
to such songs as this:&mdash;</p>

<h3>Wyatt and Surrey.</h3>

<p>The model poets, however, of this reign<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>&mdash;those
who kept alive the best old classic traditions, and
echoed with most grace and spirit the daintiness
of Italian verse, were the Earl of Surrey and Sir
Thomas Wyatt. The latter was son of an old courtier
of Henry VII., and inheritor of an estate and
castle in Kent, which he made noteworthy by his
decorative treatment, and which is even now counted
worthy a visit by those journeying through the little
town of Maidstone. He was, for those times, brilliantly
educated; was in high favor with the King
(save one enforced visit to the Tower); he translated
Petrarch, and in his own way imitated the Italian
poet’s manner, and was, by common consent, the
first to graft the “Sonnet” upon English forms of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
verse. I find nothing however in his verse one-half
so graceful or gracious as this tribute to his worth
in Tennyson’s “Queen Mary:”&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Courtier of many courts, he loves the more</div>
<div class="verse">His own gray towers, plain life, and lettered peace,</div>
<div class="verse">To read and rhyme in solitary fields;</div>
<div class="verse">The lark above, the nightingale below,</div>
<div class="verse">And answer them in song.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Surrey was well born: was son to the Duke of
Norfolk who figures in the Shakespearean play of
Henry VIII., and grandson to the Surrey who
worsted the Scotch on Flodden Field: he was companion
of the King’s son, was taught at the Universities,
at home and abroad. There was no gallant
more admired in the gayer circles of the court; he
too loved Petrarch, and made canzonets like his;
had a Geraldine (for a Laura), half real and half
mythical. The further story once obtained that he
went with a gay retinue to Florence, where the lists
were opened&mdash;in the spirit of an older chivalry&mdash;to
this Stranger Knight, who challenged the world
to combat his claims in behalf of the mythical
Geraldine. And&mdash;the story ran&mdash;there were hot-heads
who contended with him; and he unhorsed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
his antagonists, and came back brimming with honors,
to the court&mdash;before which Hugh Latimer had
preached, and where Sternhold’s psalms had been
heard&mdash;to be imprisoned for eating flesh in Lent,
in that Windsor Castle where he had often played
with the King’s son. The tale<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> is a romantic one;
but&mdash;in all that relates to the Florentine tourney&mdash;probably
untrue.</p>

<p>I give you a little taste of the graceful way in
which this poet sings of his Geraldine:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“I assure thee even by oath</div>
<div class="verse">And thereon take my hand and troth</div>
<div class="verse">That she is one of the worthiest</div>
<div class="verse">The truest and the faithfullest</div>
<div class="verse">The gentlest, and the meekest o’ mind</div>
<div class="verse">That here on earth a man may find;</div>
<div class="verse">And if that love and truth were gone</div>
<div class="verse">In her it might be found alone:</div>
<div class="verse">For in her mind no thought there is</div>
<div class="verse">But how she may be true, iwis,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
<div class="verse">And is thine own; and so she says</div>
<div class="verse">And cares for thee ten thousand ways;</div>
<div class="verse">Of thee she speaks, on thee she thinks</div>
<div class="verse">With thee she eats, with thee she drinks</div>
<div class="verse">With thee she talks, with thee she moans</div>
<div class="verse">With thee she sighs, with thee she groans</div>
<div class="verse">With thee she says&mdash;‘Farewell mine own!’</div>
<div class="verse">When thou, God knows, full far art gone.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Surrey is to be held in honor as the first poet
who wrote English blank verse; he having translated
two books of the Æneid in that form. But
this delicate singer, this gallant soldier cannot altogether
please the capricious monarch; perhaps
he is too fine a soldier; perhaps too free a liver;
perhaps he is dangerously befriended by some
ladies of the court: Quite certain it is that the
King frowns on him; and the frowns bring what
they have brought to so many others&mdash;first, imprisonment
in the Tower, and then the headsman’s
axe. In this way the poet died at thirty,
in 1547: his execution being one of the last ordered
by Henry VIII., and the King so weak that
he could only stamp, instead of signing the death
warrant.</p>

<p>Honest men breathed freer, everywhere, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
the King died, in the same year with Surrey: and
so, that great, tempestuous reign was ended.</p>

<h3>A Boy-King, a Queen, and Schoolmaster.</h3>

<p>Edward VI. succeeded his father at the age of
ten years&mdash;a precocious, consumptive boy, who
gave over his struggle with life when only sixteen;
and yet has left his “Works,” printed by the Roxburgh
Club. There’s a maturity about some of
the political suggestions in his “Journal”&mdash;not
unusual in a lively mind prematurely ripening under
stress of disease; yet we can hardly count him
a literary king.</p>

<p>The red reign of Mary, immediately following,
lasted only five years, for which, I think, all Christian
England thanked God: In those five years very
many of the strong men of whom we have talked in
this chapter came to a fiery end.</p>

<p>Only one name of literary significance do we
pluck from the annals of her time; it is that of
Roger Ascham,<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> the writer of her Latin letters, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
for a considerable time her secretary. How, being
a Protestant as he was, and an undissembling one,
he kept his head upon his shoulders so near her
throne, it is hard to conjecture. He must have
studied the art of keeping silence as well as the
arts of speech.</p>

<p>He was born in that rich, lovely region of Yorkshire&mdash;watered
by the River Swale&mdash;where we
found the young Wyclif: his father was a house-steward;
but he early made show of such qualities
as invited the assistance of rich friends, through
whose offices he was entered at St. John’s College,
Cambridge, at fifteen, and took his degree at eighteen.
He was full of American pluck, aptness, and
industry; was known specially for his large gifts
in language; a superb penman too, which was no
little accomplishment in that day; withal, he excelled
in athletics, and showed a skill with the
long-bow which made credible the traditions about
Robin Hood. They said he wasted time at this
exercise; whereupon he wrote a defence of Archery,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
which under the name of <cite>Toxophilus</cite> has come
down to our day&mdash;a model even now of good,
homely, vigorous English. “He that will write
well in any tongue,” said he, “must follow this
counsel&mdash;to speak as the common people do&mdash;to
think as wise men do.” Our teachers of rhetoric
could hardly say a better thing to-day.</p>

<p>The subject of Archery was an important one at
that period; the long-bow was still the principal
war weapon of offence: there were match-locks, indeed,
but these very cumbrous and counting for
less than those “cloth-yard” shafts which had won
the battle of Agincourt. The boy-King, Edward, to
whom Ascham taught penmanship, was an adept at
archery, and makes frequent allusion to that exercise
in his Journal. In every hamlet practice at the
long-bow was obligatory; and it was ordered by
statute that no person above the age of twenty-four,
should shoot the light-flight arrow at a distance
under two hundred and twenty yards. What would
our Archery Clubs say to this? And what, to the
further order&mdash;dating in Henry VIII.’s time&mdash;that
“all bow-staves should be three fingers thick and
seven feet long?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>This book of Ascham’s was published two years
before Henry’s death, and brought him a small pension;
under the succeeding king he went to Augsburg,
where Charles V. held his brilliant court; but
neither there, nor in Italy, did he lose his homely
and hearty English ways, and his love of English
things.</p>

<p>In his tractate of the <cite>Schoolmaster</cite>, which appeared
after his death, he bemoans the much and
idle travel of Englishmen into Italy. They have
a proverb there, he says, “<i lang="it">Un Inglese italianato é
un diabolo incarnato</i>” (an Italianized Englishman is
a devil incarnate). Going to Italy, when Tintoretto
and Raphael were yet living, and when the great
Medici family and the Borgias were spinning their
golden wheels&mdash;was, for a young Englishman of
that day, like a European trip to a young American
of ours: Ascham says&mdash;“Many being mules and
horses before they went, return swine and asses.”</p>

<p>There is much other piquant matter in this old
book of the <cite>Schoolmaster</cite>; as where he says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“When the child doeth well, either in the choosing or
true placing of his words, let the master praise him, and
say, ‘Here ye do well!’ For I assure you there is no such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
whetstone to sharpen a good wit, and encourage a will to
learning as is praise. But if the child miss, either in forgetting
a word, or in changing a good with a worse, or mis-ordering
the sentence, I would not have the master frown,
or chide with him, if the child have done his diligence and
used no truantship: For I know by good experience, that a
child shall take more profit of two faults gently warned of,
than of four things rightly hit.”</p>

</div>

<p>And this brings us to say that this good, canny,
and thrifty Roger Ascham was the early teacher, in
Greek and Latin, of the great Princess Elizabeth,
and afterward for years her secretary. You would
like to hear how he speaks of her:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It is your shame (I speak to you all young gentlemen of
England) that one mind should go beyond you all in excellency
of learning, and knowledge of divers tongues.
Point forth six of the best given gentlemen of this court,
and all they together show not so much good will, spend
not so much time, bestow not so many hours daily, orderly,
and constantly, for the increase of learning and knowledge
as doth this Princess. Yea, I believe that beside her
perfect readiness in Latin, Italian, French and Spanish, she
readeth here now, at Windsor more Greek every day, than
some prebendarys of this Church doth read Latin in a whole
week.”</p>

</div>

<p>He never speaks of her but with a hearty tenderness;
nor did she speak of him, but most kindly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
At his death, she said, “She would rather that
£10,000 had been flung into the sea.” And&mdash;seeing
her money-loving, this was very much for her
to say.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In our next chapter we shall meet this prudent
and accomplished Princess face to face&mdash;in her farthingale
and ruff&mdash;with the jewels on her fingers,
and the crown upon her head&mdash;bearing herself
right royally. And around her we shall find such
staid worthies as Burleigh and Richard Hooker;
and such bright spirits as Sidney and Raleigh, and
that sweet poet Spenser, who was in that day counting
the flowing measures of that long song, whose
mellow cadences have floated musically down from
the far days of Elizabeth to these fairer days of
ours.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<p class="dropcap">In our last talk we entered upon that brilliant
sixteenth century, within whose first quarter
three great kings held three great thrones:&mdash;Charles
V. of Spain, Francis I. of France, and Henry VIII.
of England. New questions were astir; Art&mdash;in
the seats of Art&mdash;was blazing at its best: the recent
fall of Constantinople under the Turk had sent a
tide of Greek scholars, Greek art, and Greek letters
flowing over Western Europe, and drifting into the
antiquated courts of Oxford and Cambridge. I
spoke of the magnificent Wolsey, and of his great
university endowments; also, of that ripe scholar,
Sir Thomas More, who could not mate his religion, or
his statesmanship with the caprices of the King, and
so, died by the axe. We saw Cranmer&mdash;meaning
to be good, if goodness did not call for strength;
we heard Latimer’s swift, homely speech, and saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
Tyndale with his English Testament&mdash;both these
coming to grief; and we had glimpses of John Knox
shaking the pulpit with his frail hand, and shaking
all Scotch Christendom with his fearless, strident
speech.</p>

<p>We heard the quaint psalmody of Sternhold, and
the sweeter and more heathen verse of Wyatt and
of Surrey; lastly, I gave a sketch of that old schoolmaster,
Roger Ascham, who by his life, tied the
reigns of Henry and of Elizabeth together, and who
taught Greek and Latin and penmanship and
Archery to that proud princess&mdash;whom we encounter
now&mdash;in her high ruff, and her piled-up
head-dress, with a fair jewelled hand that puts a
man’s grip upon the sceptre.</p>

<h3>Elizabethan England.</h3>

<p>Elizabeth was in her twenty-sixth year when she
came to the throne, and it was about the middle of
the sixteenth century; the precise year being 1558.
The England she was to dominate so splendidly was
not a quiet England: the fierce religious controversies
which had signalized the reign of Henry VIII.&mdash;who
thwacked with his kingly bludgeon both ways<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
and all ways&mdash;and which continued under Edward
VI.&mdash;who was feebly Protestant; and which had
caught new vigor under Mary&mdash;who was arrant
and slavish Papist&mdash;had left gouts of blood and a
dreadful exasperation. Those great Religious
Houses, which only a quarter of a century before,
were pleasantly embayed in so many charming valleys
of Great Britain&mdash;with their writing-rooms,
their busy transcribing clerks&mdash;their great gardens,
were, most of them, despoiled&mdash;and to be seen no
more. An old Venetian Ambassador,<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> writing to
the Seigneury in those days, says&mdash;“London itself is
disfigured by the ruins of a multitude of Churches
and Monasteries which once belonged to Friars and
Nuns.” Piers Plowman, long before, had attacked
the sins growing up in the pleasant Abbey Courts;
Chaucer had echoed the ridicule in his Abbot riding
to Canterbury, with jingling trappings: Gower had
repeated the assault in his <cite>Vox Clamantis</cite>, and Skelton
had turned his ragged rhymes into the same
current of satire. But all would have availed nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
except the arrogant Henry VIII. had set his foot
upon them, and crushed them out.</p>

<p>There was a wild justice in it&mdash;if not an orderly
one. The spoils went to fill the Royal coffers;
many of those beautiful properties were bestowed
upon favorites; many princely estates are still held
in England, by title tracing back to those days of
spoliation&mdash;a fact which will be called to mind,
I suspect&mdash;with unction, in case of any great social
revolution in that country. Under Mary, some
of these estates had been restored to Church dignitaries;
but the restoration had not been general:
and Elizabeth could not if she would, and
would not if she could, sanction any further restitution.</p>

<p>She was Protestant&mdash;but rather from policy than
any heartiness of belief. It did not grieve her one
whit, that her teacher, Roger Ascham, had been
private secretary to bloody Mary: the lukewarmness
of her great minister, Lord Burleigh, did not disturb
her; she always kept wax tapers burning by a
crucifix in her private chamber; a pretty rosary
gave her no shock; but she <em>was</em> shocked at the
marriage of any member of the priesthood, always.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
In fact, if Spanish bigotry had not forced her into
a resolute antagonism of Rome, I think history
would have been in doubt whether to count her
most a Lutheran, or most a Roman.</p>

<p>Yet she made the Papists smoke for it&mdash;as grimly
as ever her sister Mary did the Protestants&mdash;if
they stood one whit in the way of England’s grasp
on power.</p>

<h3>Personality of the Queen.</h3>

<p>I think our friend Mr. Froude, whose history
we all read, is a little unfair toward Queen Bess,
as he was a little over-fair, and white-wash-i-ly disposed
in the case of Henry VIII.: both tendencies
being attributable to a mania this shrewd historian
has&mdash;for unripping and oversetting established
forms of belief. I think that he not only bears
with a greedy zeal upon her too commonly manifest
selfishness and heartlessness, but that he enjoys
putting little vicious dabs of bad color upon her
picture&mdash;as when he says, “she spat, and swore
like a trooper.” Indeed it would seem that this
clever biographer had carried a good deal of his
fondness for “vicious dabs” in portraiture into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
his more recent <i lang="la">post-mortem</i> exhibits; as if it were
his duty and pleasure to hang out all sorts of
soiled linen, in his office of Clean-Scrubber: Yet, I
wish to speak with all respect of the distinguished
historian&mdash;whose vigor is conspicuous&mdash;whose industry
is remarkable, whose crisp sentences are
delightful, but whose accuracy is not of the surest;
and whose conscience does, I think, sometimes go
lame&mdash;under strain of his high, rhetorical canter.</p>

<p>The authority for all most damnatory statements
with respect to the private life of the Queen, rests
upon those Spanish Relations&mdash;so minute as to be
suspicious&mdash;if they were not also so savagely bitter
as to twist everything to the discredit of the Protestant
Sovereign. Signor Soranzo&mdash;the Venetian
ambassador (whom Froude does not cite&mdash;but
who had equal opportunities of observation with
the Spanish informer), says of Elizabeth (in a
report&mdash;not written for publication, but lying
for years in the archives of Venice): “Such an
air of dignified majesty pervades all her actions
that no one can fail to judge her a queen. She
is a good Greek and Latin scholar; and beside
her native tongue she speaks Latin, French,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
Spanish, and Italian <i lang="it">benissimo</i>&mdash;and her manners
are very modest and affable.”<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p>I talk thus much&mdash;and may talk more&mdash;about the
personality of Queen Elizabeth, because she must be
counted&mdash;in a certain not very remote sense&mdash;one
of the forces that went to endow what is called
the English Literature of her day&mdash;so instructed
was she; so full of talent; so keen-sighted; so exact&mdash;a
most extraordinary woman. We must not
think her greatness was factitious, and attributable
to her only because she was a queen. There could
be no greater mistake. She would have been great
if she had been a shoemaker’s daughter; I do not
mean that she would have rode a white horse at
Tilbury, and made the nations shake: but she
would have bound more shoes, and bound them
better, and looked sharper after the affairs of her
household than any cobbler’s wife in the land.
Elizabeth would have made a wonderful post-mistress&mdash;a
splendid head of a school&mdash;with perhaps
a little too large use of the ferule: and she would
have had her favorites, and shown it; but she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
would have lifted her pupils’ thoughts into a high
range of endeavor; she would have made an atmosphere
of intellectual ambition about her; she
would have struck fire from flinty souls; and so
she did in her court: She inspired work&mdash;inspired
imagination; may we not say that she inspired
genius. That auburn hair of hers (I suppose we
should have called it red, if her name had been
Abigail) made an aureole, around which wit coruscated
by a kind of electric affinity. It was counted
worth toil to have the honor of laying a poem at her
gracious feet, who was so royally a Queen&mdash;whose
life, and power, and will and culture, made up a
quadrature of poems.</p>

<h3>Burleigh and Others.</h3>

<p>And who was there of literary significance about
Elizabeth in those early days of her reign? Roger
Ascham was still doling out his sagacious talk, and
his good precepts; but he was not a force&mdash;only
what we might call a good creature. There was
Sackville<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> (afterward the elegant Earl of Dorset);<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
he was in his prime then, and had very likely
written his portion of the <cite>Mirror for Magistrates</cite>&mdash;a
fairish poetic history of great unfortunate
people&mdash;completed afterward by other poets, but
hardly read nowadays.</p>

<p>Old Tusser,<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> too&mdash;the farmer-poet&mdash;lived in
these times; an Essex man, of about the same age
as Ascham, but who probably never came nearer to
the court than to sing in the choir of old St. Paul’s.
He had University experience, which, if it did not
help his farming, on the banks of the Stour, did,
doubtless, enable him to equip his somewhat prosy
poems with such classic authentication and such
directness and simplicities as gave to his <cite>Pointes of
Husbandrie</cite> very great vogue. Many rhyming saws
about farming, still current among old-fashioned
country-folk, trace back to Master Tusser, who lived
and farmed successively (tradition says not very successfully)
at Ipswich, Dereham, and Norwich. His
will, however, published in these later times, shows
him to have been a man of considerable means.</p>

<p>Then there was Holinshed,<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> who, though the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
date of his birth is uncertain, must have been of
fair working age now&mdash;a homely, honest, simple-hearted
chronicler (somewhat thievish, as all the
old chroniclers were) but whose name is specially
worth keeping in mind, because he&mdash;in all probability&mdash;supplied
Shakespeare’s principal historic
reading, and furnished the crude material, afterward
beaten out into those plaques of gold, which
we call Shakespeare’s Historic Plays. Therefore, we
must always, I think, treat Holinshed with respect.
Next, there was the great Lord Burleigh,<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> the chief
minister and adviser of the Queen&mdash;whom she set
great store by: the only man she allowed to sit in
her presence; and indeed he was something heavy,
both in mind and in person; but far-sighted, honest,
keen, cautious, timid&mdash;making his nod count
more than most men’s words, and in great exigencies
standing up for the right, even against the
caprices of the sovereign. Whoever goes to Stamford
in England should not fail to run out&mdash;a mile
away only&mdash;to the princely place called Burleigh
House (now the property of the Marquis of Exeter)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
which was the home of this minister of Elizabeth’s&mdash;built
out of his savings, and equipped now with
such paintings, such gardens, such magnificent
avenues of oak, such great sweeps of velvet lawn,
such herds of loitering deer as make it one of the
show-places of England. Well&mdash;this sober-sided,
cautious Burleigh (you will get a short, but good
glimpse of him in Scott’s tragic tale of Kenilworth)
wrote a book&mdash;a sort of earlier Chesterfield’s
Letters, made up of advices for his son Robert
Cecil, who was cousin, and in early life, rival of the
great Francis Bacon. I will take out a tid-bit from
this book, that you may see how this famous Lord
Burleigh talked to his son:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“When it shall please God to bring thee to man’s estate”&mdash;he
says&mdash;“use great Providence, and circumspection in
choosing thy wife: For from thence will spring all thy
future good and evil. And it is an action of life&mdash;like unto
a stratagem of War, wherein a man can err but once. If
thy estate be good, match near home and at leisure: if
weak&mdash;far off, and quickly. Inquire diligently of her disposition,
and how her parents have been inclined in their
youth. Choose not a base, and uncomely creature, altogether
for Wealth; for it will cause contempt in others, and
loathing in thee: Neither make choice of a fool, for she
will be thy continual disgrace, and it will irk thee to hear
her talk.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<h3>A Group of Great Names.</h3>

<p>But the greater names which went to illustrate
with their splendor the times of Elizabeth, only began
to come to people’s knowledge after she had
been upon the throne some twenty years.</p>

<p>Spenser was a boy of five, when she came
to power: John Lilly, the author of <cite>Euphues</cite>
which has given us the word <em>euphuistic</em>, and which
provoked abundant caricatures, of more or less fairness&mdash;was
born the same year with Spenser; Sir
Philip Sidney a year later; Sir Walter Raleigh
a year earlier (1553); Richard Hooker, the author
of the <cite>Ecclesiastical Polity</cite>, in 1554; Lord Bacon
in 1561; Shakespeare in 1564. These are great
names to stand so thickly strewed over ten or
twelve years of time. I do not name them, because
I lay great stress on special dates: For my
own part, I find them hard things to keep in mind&mdash;except
I group them thus&mdash;and I think a man or
woman can work and worry at worthier particularities
than these. But when Elizabeth had been
twenty years a Queen, and was in the prime of her
womanly powers&mdash;six years after the slaughter of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
St. Bartholomew&mdash;when the first English colony
had just been planted in Virginia, and Sir Francis
Drake was coasting up and down the shores of California;
when Shakespeare was but a lad of fourteen,
and poaching (if he ever did poach there&mdash;which
is doubtful) in Charlecote Park; when Francis
Bacon was seventeen, and was studying in Paris&mdash;Philip
Sidney was twenty-four; in the ripeness
of his young manhood, and just returned from
Holland, he was making love&mdash;vainly as it proved&mdash;to
the famous and the ill-fated Penelope Devereaux.</p>

<p>Richard Hooker&mdash;of the same age, was teaching
Hebrew in the University of Oxford, and had not yet
made that unfortunate London marriage (tho’ very
near it) by which he was yoked with one whom old
Izaak Walton&mdash;charitable as the old angler was&mdash;describes
as a silly, clownish woman, and withal a
perfect Xantippe.</p>

<p>The circumstances which led to this awkward
marriage show so well the child-like simplicity of
this excellent man, that they are worth noting.
He had come up to London, and was housed
where preachers were wont to go; and it being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
foul weather, and he thoroughly wetted, was behoven
to the hostess for dry clothes, and such
other attentions as made him look upon her as a
special Providence, who could advise and care for
him in all things: So, he accepted her proffer to
him of her own daughter, who proved to him quite
another sort of Providence, and a grievous thorn in
the side; and when his friends, on visits to his
homestead in after years, found the author of the
<cite>Ecclesiastical Polity</cite>&mdash;rocking the cradle, or minding
the sheep, or looking after the kettles, and expressed
sympathy&mdash;“My dear fellows,” said he&mdash;“if
Saints have usually a double share in the miseries
of this Life, I, that am none, ought not to repine
at what my Wise Creator hath appointed for
me, but labor (as indeed I do daily) to submit mine
to his will and possess my soul in patience and
peace.”</p>

<p>I don’t know if any of our parish will care to read
the <cite>Ecclesiastical Polity</cite>; but if you have courage
thereto, you will find in this old master of sound
and cumbrous English prose, passages of rare eloquence,
and many turns of expression, which for
their winning grace, their aptitude, their quality of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
fastening themselves upon the mind, are not overmatched
by those of any Elizabethan writer. His
theology is old and rankly conservative; but he
shows throughout a beautiful reverence for that
all-embracing Law, “whose seat (as he says) is the
Bosom of God, and whose voice is the Harmony
of the World.”<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<h3>Edmund Spenser.</h3>

<p>As for Edmund Spenser, he was a year older at
this date&mdash;twenty-five: he had taken his master’s
degree at Cambridge and had just returned to
London from a visit to the North of England,
where he had encountered some fair damsel to
whom he had been paying weary and vain suit,
and whom he had embalmed in his <cite>Shepherd’s
Calendar</cite> (just then being made ready for the press)
under the name of Rosalind.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Ah, faithless Rosalind, and voyd of grace,</div>
<div class="verse">That art the root of all this ruthful woe</div>
<div class="verse">[My] teares would make the hardest flint to flow;”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent">and his tears keep a-drip through a great many of
those charming eclogues&mdash;called the <cite>Shepherd’s
Calendar</cite>. Some of the commentators on Spenser
have queried&mdash;gravely&mdash;whether he ever forgot
this Rosalind; and whether the occurrence of the
name and certain woe-worn words in some madrigal
of later years did not show a wound unhealed
and bleeding. We are all at liberty to guess, and
I am inclined to doubt here. I think he was equal
to forgetting this Rosalind before the ink of the
<cite>Shepherd’s Calendar</cite> was fairly dry. He loved
dreams and fed on dreams; and I suspect enjoyed
the dream of his woe more than he ever suffered
from a sting of rebuff.</p>

<p>Indeed, much as we must all admire his poetic
fervor and fancies, I do not find in him traces of heroic
mould;&mdash;easily friendly rather than firmly
so;&mdash;full of an effusive piety, but not coming in
way of martyrdom for faith’s sake;&mdash;a tenderly
contemplative man, loving and sensing beauty in
the same sure and abounding way in which Turner
has sense of color&mdash;exhaustless in his stock of brilliant
and ingenious imagery&mdash;running to similes as
mountain rills run to rivers; a courtier withal&mdash;honeyed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
and sometimes fulsome; a richly presentable
man (if portraits may be trusted), with a well-trimmed
face, a cautious face&mdash;dare I say&mdash;almost
a smirking face;&mdash;the face of a self-contained man
who thinks allowably well of his parts, and is determined
to make the most of them. And in the
brows over the fine eyes there is a bulging out&mdash;where
phrenologists place the bump of language&mdash;that
shows where his forte lies: No such word-master
had been heard to sing since the days when
Chaucer sung. He is deeply read in Chaucer too;
and read in all&mdash;worth reading&mdash;who came between.
His lingual aptitudes are amazing. He can
tear words in tatters, and he can string them rhythmically
in all shapes; he makes his own law in language,
as he grows heated in his work; twists old
phrases out of shape; makes new ones; binds them
together; tosses them as he will to the changing
level of his thought: so that whereas one may go to
Chaucer, in points of language, as to an authority&mdash;one
goes to Spenser as to a mine of graceful and
euphonious phrases: but the authority is wanting&mdash;or,
at least, is not so safe. He makes uses for
words which no analogy and no good order can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
recognize. And his new words are not so much the
product of keen, shrewd search after what will
fullest and strongest express a feeling or a thought,
or give color to epithet, as they are the luxuriant
outcropping of a tropical genius for language,
which delights in abundant forms, and makes them
with an easy show of its own fecundity, or for the
chance purpose of filling a line, or meting out the
bounds of an orderly prosody.</p>

<p>He came up to London, as I said, about the year
1578, at the invitation of a prig of a classmate, who
makes him known to Philip Sidney: Sidney is the
very man to recognize and appreciate the tender
beauty of those woful plaints in the <cite>Shepherd’s Calendar</cite>,
and invites the poet down to Penshurst, that
charming home of the Sidneys, in Kent. There,
such interest is made for him that he is appointed
to a secretaryship in Ireland, where the Queen’s
lieutenants are stamping out revolt. Spenser sees
much of this fiery work; and its blaze reddens some
of the pages of the <cite>Faery Queen</cite>. In the distribution
of spoils, after the Irish revolt was put down,
the poet has bestowed upon him, amongst other
plums, some three thousand acres of wild land,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
with Kilcolman Castle, which stands upon a valley
spur of this domain. This castle is represented
as an uninteresting fortress&mdash;like Johnnie Armstrong’s
tower in Scotland&mdash;upon the borders of
a small lake or mere, and the landscape&mdash;stretching
in unlovely waste around it&mdash;savage and low
and tame. Yet he finds rich rural pictures there&mdash;this
idealist and dreamer: let him see only so
much of sky as comes between the roofs of a city
alley, and he will pluck out of it a multitude of
twinkling stars; let him look upon a rood square
of brown grass-land, and he will set it alight with
scores of daisies and of primroses.</p>

<h3>The Faery Queen.</h3>

<p>And it is in this easy way he plants the men and
women, the hags and demons, the wizards and dragons
that figure in the phantasmagoria of the <cite>Faery
Queen</cite>; they come and go like twilight shadows;
they have no root of realism.</p>

<p>There is reason to believe that the first cantos of
this poem were blocked out in his mind before
leaving England; perhaps the scheme had been
talked over with his friend Sidney; in any event, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
is quite certain that they underwent elaboration at
Kilcolman Castle, and some portions doubtless took
color from the dreary days of rapine and of war he
saw there. I will not ask if you have read the
<cite>Faery Queen</cite>: I fear that a great many dishonest
speeches are made on that score; I am afraid that I
equivocated myself in youngish days; but now I
will be honest in saying&mdash;I never read it through
continuously and of set purpose; I have tried it&mdash;on
winter nights, and gone to sleep in my chair: I
have tried it, under trees in summer, and have gone
to sleep on the turf: I have tried it, in the first
blush of a spring morning, and have gone&mdash;to
breakfast.</p>

<p>Yet there are many who enjoy it intensely and
continuously: Mr. Saintsbury says, courageously,
that it is the only long poem he honestly wishes
were longer. It is certainly full of idealism; it is
full of sweet fancies; it is rich in dragonly horrors;
it is crammed with exquisite harmonies. But&mdash;its
tenderer heroines are so shadowy, you cannot bind
them to your heart; nay, you can scarce follow them
with your eyes: Now, you catch a strain which
seems to carry a sweet womanly image of flesh and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
blood&mdash;of heartiness and warmth. But&mdash;at the
turning of a page&mdash;his wealth of words so enwraps
her in glowing epithets, that she fades on
your vision to a mere iridescence and a creature
of Cloud-land.</p>

<p class="noindent">and so on, by dozens, by scores, by hundreds&mdash;delicate,
mellifluous stanzas&mdash;fair ladies and brazen-scaled
dragons, lions and fleecy lambs, sweet purling
brooks and horrors of Pandemonium, story
grafted upon story, and dreams grafted upon these,
and still flowing on&mdash;canto after canto&mdash;until the
worldlings are tempted to exclaim, “When will he
stop?” It is an exclamation that a good many
lesser men than Spenser have tempted&mdash;in class-rooms,
in lecture-rooms, and in pulpits. And I
am wicked enough to think that if a third had
been shorn away by the poet from that over-full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
and over-epitheted poem of the <cite>Faery Queen</cite>, it
would have reached farther, and come nearer to
more minds and hearts. But who&mdash;save the
master&mdash;shall ever put the shears into that dainty
broidery where gorgeous flowers lie enmeshed in
page-long tangles, and where wanton tendrils of
words enlace and tie together whole platoons of
verse?</p>

<p>In brief, the Poem is a great, cumbrous, beautiful,
bewildering, meandering Allegory, in which
he assigns to every Virtue a Knight to be ensampler
and defender of the same, and puts these
Knights to battle with all the vices represented by
elfin hags, or scaled dragons, or beautiful women;
and so the battles rage and the storms beat. But
we lose sight of his moral in the smoke of the conflict.
The skeleton of his ethics is overlaid with
the wallets of fair flesh, and with splendid trappings;
his abounding figures gallop away with
the logic; his roses cumber all his corn-ground.
There are no passages of condensed meaning, or
of wondrous intuition that give one pause, and that
stick by us like a burr. There is a symphonious
clatter of hammers upon golden-headed tacks, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
no such pounding blow as drives a big nail
home.</p>

<p>All this is the criticism of a matter-of-fact man,
who perhaps has no right of utterance&mdash;as if one
without knowledge of music should criticise its
cumulated triumphs. Many a man can enjoy a
burst of balladry&mdash;of little vagrant songs&mdash;who
is crushed and bored by the pretty tangles and
symphonies of an opera. Spenser was poets’ poet&mdash;not
people’s poet; hardly can be till people are
steeped in that refinement, that poetic sensibility,
which only poets are supposed to possess. And
I am rather unpleasantly conscious that I may
offend intense lovers of this great singer by such
mention of him: painfully conscious, too, that it
may have its source (as Saintsbury assures us must
be the case) in a poetic inaptitude to give largest
and adequate relish to the tender harmonies and
the mythical reaches of his sweetly burdened song.
But shall I not be honest?</p>

<p>Yet Spenser is never ribald, never vulgar, rarely
indelicate, even measured by modern standards:
He always has a welcoming word for honesty, and
for bravery, and, I think, the welcomest word of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
all for Love, which he counts, as so many young
people do, the chiefest duty of man.</p>

<p>Once upon a time, there comes to see Spenser in
his Kilcolman home&mdash;that daring adventurer, that
roving knight, Sir Walter Raleigh&mdash;who is so well
taught, so elegant, so brave that he can make the
bright eyes even of Queen Bess twinkle again, with
the courtliness of his adulation; he comes, I say,
to see Spenser;&mdash;for he too has a grant of some
forty thousand acres carved out of that ever-wretched
and misgoverned Ireland: and Spenser,
to entertain his friend, reads somewhat of the <cite>Faery
Queene</cite> (not more than one canto I suspect), and Sir
Walter locks arms with the poet, and carries him
off to London, and presents him to the Queen; and
Spenser weaves subtle, honeyed flattery for this
great <cite>Gloriana</cite>; and his book is printed; and the
Queen smiles on him, and gives him her jewelled
hand to kiss, and a pension of £50 a year, which the
stout old Burleigh thinks too much; and which
Spenser, and poets all, think too beggarly small.
There are little poems that come after this, commemorating
this trip to Court, and Raleigh’s hobnobbing
with him&mdash;</p>

<p>To my mind the gracious humanity&mdash;the exquisite
naturalness of this is worth an ocean of
cloying prettinesses about <cite>Gloriana</cite> and <cite>Britomart</cite>.
Not very many years after this&mdash;just how many we
cannot say&mdash;comes the great tragedy of his life: A
new Irish rebellion (that of Tyrone) sends up its
tide of fire and blood around his home of Kilcolman;
his crops, his barns, his cattle, his poor babe<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>&mdash;the
last born&mdash;all are smothered, and consumed
away in that fiery wrack and ruin. He makes his
way broken-hearted to London again; his old welcome
as an adulator of the Queen is at an end;
Raleigh is not actively helpful; Sidney is dead; he
has some cheap lodging almost under the shadow of
Westminster: He is sick, maimed in body and in
soul; other accounts&mdash;not yet wholly discredited&mdash;represent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
him as miserably poor; bread, even,
hard to come by; my Lord of Essex&mdash;a new patron&mdash;sends
him a few guineas; and the poor poet
murmurs&mdash;too late&mdash;too late!&mdash;and so he dies
(1599). How glad we should have been to help
him, had we been living in that time, and all this
tale of suffering had been true;&mdash;so we think: and
yet, ten to one we should have said&mdash;“Poor fellow,
what a pity!”&mdash;and buttoned up our pockets, as
we do now.</p>

<h3>Philip Sidney.</h3>

<p>Meantime what has become of that Philip Sidney<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>
who flashed upon us under the eyes of Elizabeth at
the age of twenty-four? You know him as the chivalric
soldier and the model gentleman. Students
and young people all, who are under the glamour of
youthful enthusiasms, are apt to have a great fondness
for Philip Sidney: But if any of my young
readers chance to be projecting an essay about that
courteous gentleman&mdash;and I know they will, if they
have not already&mdash;I would counsel them to forego
any mention of the story about the dying soldier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
and the cup of water. It has been cruelly overworked
already. Indeed it might have been
matched in scores of cases upon the battle-fields of
our own war: When the last shattering blow comes
to our poor humanity, the better nature in us does
somehow lean kindly out, in glance and in purpose.
Yet Philip Sidney was certainly a man of great
kindness and full of amiabilities and courtesies.</p>

<p>Why, pray, should he not have been? Consider
that in all his young life he was wrapped in purple.
It is no bad thing in any day to be born eldest son
of an old and wealthy and titled family of England;
but it is something more to be born eldest son of
a Sidney&mdash;nephew to Leicester, prime favorite of
the Queen, cousin to the Northumberlands, the
Sutherlands, the Warwicks&mdash;heir to that old baronial
pile of Penshurst, toward which summer
loiterers go now, every year, from far-away countries&mdash;to
admire its red roofs&mdash;its gray walls
curtained with ivy&mdash;its tall chimneys, that have
smoked with the goodly hospitalities of centuries&mdash;its
charming wood-walks, that Ben Jonson and
Spenser and Massinger have known&mdash;its courts
and parterres and terraces, where “Sidney’s sister,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
Pembroke’s mother,” gathered posies&mdash;its far-reaching
lovely landscape, with Penshurst church
cropping out near by&mdash;blue, hazy heights off by
Tunbridge&mdash;lanes bowered with hedge-rows&mdash;wide-lying
wavy, grain-fields, and sheep feeding in
the hollows of the hills. He was born heir to all
this, I say, and had the best masters, the tenderest
and the worthiest of mothers&mdash;who writes to
him in this style,</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Your noble Father hath taken pains, with his own hand,
to give you in this&mdash;His Letter&mdash;so wise precepts for you to
follow with a diligent mind, as I will not withdraw your eyes
from beholding, and reverent honoring the same&mdash;no, not so
long a time as to read any letter from me: Wherefor&mdash;I only
bless you&mdash;with my desire to God to plant in you his grace,
and have always before your mind the excellent councils of
my Lord, your dear Father: Farewell, my little Philip; and,
once again, the Lord bless you!</p>

<p class="center">“Your loving mother,</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Marie Sidney</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p>Ought not a boy, with such a mother, and Penshurst
in prospect, and cousinly relations with the
Talbots and Howards and Stanleys to be gentlemanly
and amiable? Then&mdash;his great-uncle&mdash;Leicester
(who is Chancellor of the University)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
writes up to Oxford, where young Sidney is reading
for his degree&mdash;“Pray have my boy, Philip
Sidney, who is delicate, excused from fasting during
Lent.” And there is a plot afoot to marry this
young Oxford man to Anne, daughter of that
Lord Burleigh I told you of, and there are letters
about the negotiation still extant. Would you like
to hear how Lord Burleigh discusses his daughter’s
affairs?</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I have been pressed,” he says, “with kind offers of my
lord of Leicester, and have accorded with him, upon articles
(by a manner of A. B. C.) without naming persons&mdash;that&mdash;if
P. S. and A. C. hereafter shall like to marry, then shall
H. S. (father of P. S.) make assurances, etc., and W. C.
[that’s Lord Burleigh] father of A. C. shall pay, etc.: What
may follow, I know not: but meanwhile P. S. and A. C.
shall have full liberty.”</p>

</div>

<p>What did follow was, that old Burleigh thought
better of it, and married his daughter to a bigger
title&mdash;that is Lord Oxford, a learned and elegant,
but brutal man, who broke poor Anne Cecil’s heart.</p>

<p>Sidney, after his Oxford course, and another at
Cambridge (as some authorities say) went&mdash;as was
the further mode&mdash;upon his travels: and goes,
with the same golden luck upon him, to the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
house of Walsingham, ambassador of England, in
Paris. Why not be gentle? What is to provoke?
It is quite a different thing&mdash;as many another
Cambridge man knew (Spenser among them), to
be gentle and bland and forbearing, when illness
seizes, when poverty pinches, when friends backslide,
when Heaven’s gates seem shut;&mdash;then,
amiability and gentleness and forbearance are indeed
crowning graces, and will unlock, I think, a
good many of the doors upon the courts, where the
weary shall be at rest.</p>

<p>Sidney is at Paris when that virago Catharine
de’ Medici was lording it over her sons, and over
France;&mdash;there, too, as it chanced, through the
slaughter of St. Bartholomew’s day, from which
bloody holocaust he presently recoils, and continues
his travel over the Continent, writing very
charming, practical letters to his younger brother
Robert:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“You think my experience,” he says, “has grown from
the good things I have learned: but I know the only experience
which I have gotten is, to find how much I <em>might</em> have
learned and how much indeed I have missed&mdash;for want
of directing my course to the right end and by the right
means.” And again he tells him, “not to go travel&mdash;as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
many people do&mdash;merely out of a tickling humor to do as
other men have done, or to talk of having been.”</p>

</div>

<p>He goes leisurely into Italy&mdash;is for some time at
the famous University of Padua; he is in Venice
too during the great revels which were had there in
1574, in honor of Henry III. (of France). The Piazza
of San Marco was for days and nights together
a blaze of light and of splendor: what a city to
visit for this young Briton, who came accredited by
Elizabeth and by Leicester! The palaces of the
Foscari and of the Contarini would be open to him;
the younger Aldus Manutius was making imprints
of the classics that would delight his eye; the
temple fronts of Palladio were in their first freshness:
Did he love finer forms of art&mdash;the great
houses were rich in its trophies: the elder Palma
and Tintoretto were still at work: even the veteran
Titian was carrying his ninety-eight years with a
stately stride along the Rivi of the canal: if he
loved adventure, the Venetian ladies were very
beautiful, and the masks of the Ridotto gave him
the freedom of their smiles; the escapade of Bianca
Capello was a story of only yesterday; and
for other romance&mdash;the air was full of it; snatches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
from Tasso’s <cite>Rinaldo</cite><a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> were on the lips of the gondoliers,
and poetic legends lurked in every ripple of
the sea that broke upon the palace steps. It is said
that Sidney was painted in Venice by Paul Veronese;
and if one is cunning in those matters he
may be able to trace the likeness of the heir of
Penshurst in some one of those who belong to the
great groups of noble men and women which the
Veronese has left upon the walls of the Ducal Palace.</p>

<p>In 1575 he came home, with all the polish that
European courts and European culture could give
him. We may be sure that he paid dainty compliments
to the Queen&mdash;then in the full bloom of
womanhood: we may be sure that she devoured
them all with a relish that her queenliness could
not wholly conceal. He won his sobriquet of “The
Gentleman” in these times; elegantly courteous;
saying the right thing just when he should say it:&mdash;perhaps
too elegantly courteous&mdash;too insistent
that even a “Good-morning” should be spoken at
precisely the right time, and in the right key&mdash;too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
observant of the starched laws of a deportment
that chills by its own consciousness of unvarying
propriety, as if&mdash;well, I had almost said&mdash;as if
he had been born in Boston. His favorite sister
meantime has married one of the Pembrokes, and
has a princely place down at Wilton, near Salisbury
(now another haunt of pleasure-seekers). Sidney
was often there; and he wrote for this cherished
sister his book, or poem&mdash;(call it how we will)
of <cite>Arcadia</cite>; writing it, as he says, off-hand&mdash;and
without re-reading&mdash;sheet by sheet, for her
pleasure: I am sorry he ever said this; it provokes
hot-heads to a carelessness that never wins results
worth winning. Indeed I think Sidney put more
care to his <cite>Arcadia</cite> than he confessed; though it is
true, he expressed the wish on his deathbed, that
it should never be printed.</p>

<p>Shall I tell you anything of it&mdash;that it is an
Allegory&mdash;shaped in fact after a famous Italian
poem of the same name&mdash;that few people now
read it continuously; that it requires great pluck to
do so; and yet that no one can dip into it&mdash;high
or low&mdash;without finding rich euphuisms, poetic
symphonies, noble characters, dexterous experimentation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
in verse&mdash;iambics, sapphics, hexameters,
all interlaced with a sonorous grandiloquence of
prose&mdash;a curious medley, very fine, and <em>very</em> dull?
When published after his death it ran through
edition after edition, and young wives were gravely
cautioned not to spend too much time over that
cherished volume. His little book of the <cite>Defence of
Poesie</cite>, which he also wrote down at Wilton, appeals
more nearly to our sympathies, and may be counted
still a good and noble argument for the Art of
Poetry. And Sidney gave proof of his skill in that
art, far beyond anything in the <cite>Arcadia</cite>&mdash;in some
of those amatory poems under title of <cite>Astrophel and
Stella</cite>, which were supposed to have grown out of
his fruitless love for Penelope Devereux, to which I
made early reference. I cite a single sonnet that
you may see his manner:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“<em>Stella</em>, think not, that I by verse seek fame,</div>
<div class="verse">Who seek, who hope, who love, who live&mdash;but thee;</div>
<div class="verse">Thine eyes my pride, thy lips mine history.</div>
<div class="verse">If thou praise not, all other praise is shame,</div>
<div class="verse">Nor so ambitious am I as to frame</div>
<div class="verse">A nest for my young praise in laurel tree;</div>
<div class="verse">In truth I vow I wish not there should be</div>
<div class="verse">Graved in my epitaph, a Poet’s name.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Nor, if I would, could I just title make</div>
<div class="verse">That any laud thereof, to me should grow</div>
<div class="verse">Without&mdash;my plumes from other wings I take&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">For nothing from <em>my</em> wit or will doth flow</div>
<div class="verse">Since all my words <em>thy</em> beauty doth indite,</div>
<div class="verse">And Love doth hold my hand, and <em>make</em> me write.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But it is, after all, more his personality than his
books that draws our attention toward him, amid
that galaxy of bright spirits which is gathering
around the court of Elizabeth. In all the revels,
and the pageants of the day the eyes of thousands
fasten upon his fine figure and his noble presence.
Though Scott&mdash;singularly enough&mdash;passes him by
without mention, he is down at Kenilworth, when
the ambitious Leicester turns his castle-gardens
into a Paradise to welcome his sovereign. When
he goes as ambassador to Rudolph of Germany, he
hangs golden blazonry upon the walls of his house:
Englishmen, everywhere, are proud of this fine
gentleman, Sidney, who can talk in so many languages,
who can turn a sonnet to a lady’s eyebrow,
who can fence with the best swordsmen of
any court, who can play upon six instruments of
music, who can outdance even his Grace of Anjou.
His death was in keeping with his life; it happened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
in the war of the Low Countries, and was
due to a brilliant piece of bravado; he and his
companions fighting (as at Balaclava in the Charge
of the Light Brigade) where there was little hope
of conquest. All round them&mdash;in front&mdash;in rear&mdash;in
flank&mdash;the arquebuses and the cannon
twanged and roared. They beat down the gunners;
they sabred the men-at-arms; thrice and four
times they cut red ways through the beleaguering
enemy; but at last, a cruel musket-ball came crashing
through the thigh of this brave, polished gentleman&mdash;Philip
Sidney&mdash;and gave him his death-wound.
Twenty-five days he lingered, saying
brave and memorable things&mdash;sending courteous
messages, as if the sheen of royalty were still
upon him&mdash;doing tender acts for those nearest
him, and dying, with a great and a most worthy
calm.</p>

<p>We may well believe that the Queen found somewhat
to wipe from her cheek when the tale came of
the death of “my Philip,” the pride of her court.
Leicester, too, must have minded it sorely: and of
a surety Spenser in his far home of Kilcolman;
writing there, maybe&mdash;by the Mulla shore&mdash;his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
apostrophe to Sidney’s soul, so full of his sweetness
and of his wonderful word-craft:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent1">“Ah me, can so Divine a thing be dead?</div>
<div class="verse">Ah no: it is not dead, nor can it die</div>
<div class="verse indent1">But lives for aye in Blissful Paradise:</div>
<div class="verse">Where, like a new-born Babe, it soft doth lie</div>
<div class="verse indent1">In bed of Lilies, wrapped in tender wise</div>
<div class="verse indent1">And compassed all about with Roses sweet</div>
<div class="verse indent1">And dainty violets, from head to feet.</div>

<div class="verse">To him do sweetly carol, day and night</div>
<div class="verse indent1">And with strange notes&mdash;of him well understood</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Lull him asleep in angelic Delight</div>
<div class="verse">Whilst in sweet dreams, to him presented be</div>
<div class="verse">Immortal beauties, which no eye may see.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Two black palls fling their shadows on the court
of Elizabeth in 1587: Sidney died in October of
1586; and in the following February Mary Queen
of Scots was beheaded. The next year the Spanish
Armada is swept from the seas, and all England is
given up to rejoicings. And as we look back upon
this period and catch its alternating light and shade
on the pages of the historians and in the lives of
English poets and statesmen, the great Queen, in
her ruff and laces, and with her coronet of jewels,
seems somehow, throughout all, the central figure.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
We see Raleigh the Captain of her Guard&mdash;the
valiant knight, the scholar, the ready poet&mdash;but
readiest of all to bring his fine figure and his
stately gallantries to her court: We see Sir Francis
Drake, with his full beard and bullet-head&mdash;all
browned with his long voyages, from which
he has come laden with ingots of Spanish gold&mdash;swinging
with his sailor-gait into her august
presence: We catch sight of Lord Burleigh, feeble
now with the weight of years, leading up that
young nephew of his&mdash;Francis Bacon, that he may
kiss the Queen’s hand and do service for favors
which shall make him in time Lord Chancellor of
England. Perhaps the rash, headstrong Oxford
may be in presence, whose poor wife was once
the affianced of Sidney: And the elegant Lord
Buckhurst, decorous with the white hair of age,
who, in his younger days, when plain Thomas
Sackville, had contributed the best parts to the
<cite>Mirror for Magistrates</cite>: Richard Hooker, too, may
be there&mdash;come up from the “peace and privacy”
of his country parsonage&mdash;in his sombre clerical
dress, bent with study, but in the prime of his
age and power, with the calm face and the severe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
philosophy with which he has confronted a termagant
of a wife and the beginnings of Dissent.
And, if not in this presence, yet somewhere in London
might have been found, in that day, a young
man, not much past twenty&mdash;just up from Stratford-upon-Avon&mdash;to
take his part in playing at the
Globe Theatre; yet not wholly like other players.
Even now, while all these worthies are gathering
about the august Queen in her brilliant halls at
Greenwich or at Hampton Court, this young Stratford
man may be seated upon the steps of Old St.
Paul’s&mdash;with his chin upon his hand&mdash;looking
out on the multitudinous human tide, which even
then swept down Ludgate Hill, and meditating
the speeches of those shadowy courtiers of his&mdash;only
creatures of his day-dreams; yet they are to
carry his messages of wisdom into all lands and
languages.</p>

<p>But I must shut the books where I see these figures
come and go.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<p class="dropcap">As we open our budget to-day, we are still
under kingship of the great Queen Bess, in
whose presence we saw the portentous Lord Burleigh,
whose nod has passed into history; we saw,
too, in our swift way, the wise, the judicious, the
simple-minded, the mismarried Richard Hooker.
We called Spenser before us, and had a taste of
those ever-sweet poems of his&mdash;ever sweet, though
ever so long. Then his friend Philip Sidney
flashed across our view, the over-fine gentleman,
yet full of nobility and courage, who wrote a long
book, <cite>Arcadia</cite>, so bright with yellow splendor as to
tire one; and still so full of high thinking as to warrant
his fame and to lend a halo to his brave and
tragic death. You may remember, too, that I made
short mention of a certain John Lyly, who was
about the same age with Spenser, and who, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
his pretty euphuisms came to cut a larger figure in
the days of Elizabeth than many stronger men did.</p>

<h3>John Lyly.</h3>

<p>I recur to him now and tell you more of him,
because he did in his time set a sort of fashion in
letters. He was an Oxford man,<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> born down in
Kent, and at twenty-five, or thereabout, made his
fame by a book, which grew out of suggestions (not
only of name but largely of intent and purpose) in
the <cite>Schoolmaster</cite> of Roger Ascham; and thus it happens
over and over in the fields of literature, that a
plodding man will drop from his store a nugget,
over which some fellow of lively parts will stumble
into renown.</p>

<p>The book I refer to was called <cite>Euphues, or the
Anatomy of Wit</cite>, which came into such extraordinary
favor that he wrote shortly after another,
called <cite>Euphues and his England</cite>. And the fashion
that he set, was a fashion of affectations&mdash;of prettinesses
of speech&mdash;of piling words on words, daintier
and daintier&mdash;antithesis upon antithesis, with
flavors of wide reading thrown in, and spangled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
with classic terms and far-fetched similes&mdash;so that
ladies ambitious of literary fame larded their talk
with these fine euphuisms of Mr. Lyly. Something
of a coxcomb I think we must reckon him;
we might almost say an Oscar Wilde of letters&mdash;posing
as finely and as capable of drawing female
shoals in his wake. His strain for verbal felicities,
always noticeable, comparing with good, simple,
downright English, as a dancing-master’s mincing
step, compares with the assured, steady tread of a
go-ahead pedestrian, who thinks nothing of attitudes.
Scott, you will remember, sought to caricature
the Euphuist, in a somewhat exaggerated
way, in Sir Piercie Shafton, who figures in his story
of the <cite>Monastery</cite>; he himself, however, in the later
annotations of his novel, confesses his failure, and
admitted the justice of the criticism which declared
Sir Piercie a bore. Shakespeare, also, at a time not
far removed from Lyly’s conquest, perhaps intended
a slap at the euphuistic craze,<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> in the pedant
Schoolmaster’s talk of “Love’s Labor’s Lost.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>Yet there was a certain good in this massing of
epithets, and in this tesselated cumulation of nice
bits of language, from which the more wary and
skilful of writers could choose&mdash;as from a great vocabulary&mdash;what
words were cleanest and clearest.
Nor do I wish to give the impression that there
were no evidences of thoughtfulness or of good purpose,
under Lyly’s tintinnabulation of words. Hazlitt
thought excellently well of him; and Charles
Kingsley, in these later times, has pronounced extravagant
eulogy of him. Indeed he had high
moral likings, though his inspirations are many of
them from Plato or Boëthius; it is questionable
also if he did not pilfer from Plutarch; certainly he
sugar-coats with his language a great many heathen
pills.</p>

<p>In observation he is very acute. That <cite>Euphues</cite>
who gives name to his book, is an Athenian youth
of rare parts&mdash;“well-constituted” as the Greek implies&mdash;who
has lived long in Italy, and who talks
in this strain of the ladies he saw on a visit to England:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The English Damoiselles have their bookes tied to their
girdles&mdash;not feathers&mdash;who are as cunning in the Scriptures
as you are in Ariosto or Petrark. It is the most gorgeous
court [of England] that ever I have seene or heard of; but
yet do they not use their apparel so nicely as you in Italy,
who thinke scorne to kneele at service, for fear of wrinckles
in your silk, who dare not lift up your head to heaven, for
fear of rumpling the ruffs in your neck; yet your handes,
I confess, are holden up, rather I thinke, to show your
ringes, than to manifest your righteousness.”</p>

</div>

<p>Elizabeth would have very probably relished this
sort of talk, and have commended the writer in person;
nor can there be any doubt that, in such event,
Lyly would have mumbled his thanks in kissing
the royal hands: there are complaining letters of
his on the score of insufficient court patronage,
which are not high-toned, and which make us a little
doubtful of a goodly manhood in him. Certainly
his deservings were great, by reason of the
plays which he wrote for her Majesty’s Company of
Child-players, and which were acted at the Chapel
Royal and in the palaces. In some of these there
are turns of expression and of dramatic incident
which Shakespeare did not hesitate to convert to
his larger purposes; indeed there is, up and down
in them, abundance of dainty word-craft&mdash;of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
ingenuity&mdash;of more than Elizabethan delicacy too,
and from time to time, some sweet little lyrical outburst
that holds place still in the anthologies.</p>

<p>One of these, with which I daresay you may be
over-familiar, is worth quoting again. It is called
Apelles’ Song, and it is from the play of “Alexander
and Campaspe:”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Cupid and my Campaspe played</div>
<div class="verse">At cards for kisses&mdash;Cupid paid.</div>
<div class="verse">He stakes his quiver, bows and arrows,</div>
<div class="verse">His mother’s doves, and team of sparrows:</div>
<div class="verse">Loses them too: then down he throws</div>
<div class="verse">The coral of his lip&mdash;the Rose</div>
<div class="verse">Growing on’s cheek (but none knows how);</div>
<div class="verse">With these the crystal of his brow,</div>
<div class="verse">And then the dimple of his chin&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">All these did my Campaspe win.</div>
<div class="verse">At last, he set her both his eyes&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">She won; and Cupid blind did rise.</div>
<div class="verse">O Love, has she done this to thee?</div>
<div class="verse">What shall, alas! become of me?”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He puts, too, into imitative jingle of words the
song of the Nightingale&mdash;(as Bryant has done for
the Bobolink); and of the strain of the skylark
nothing prettier was ever said than Mr. Lyly says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“How, at Heaven’s gate she claps her wings,</div>
<div class="verse">The morn not waking&mdash;till <em>she</em> sings.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<h3>Francis Bacon.</h3>

<p>We go away from singing skylarks to find the
next character that I shall cull out from these Elizabethan
times to set before you: this is Lord Bacon&mdash;or,
to give him his true title, Lord Verulam&mdash;there
being, in fact, the same impropriety in
saying Lord Bacon (if custom had not “brazed it
so”) that there would be in saying Lord D’Israeli
for Lord Beaconsfield.</p>

<p>Here was a great mind&mdash;a wonderful intellect
which everyone admired, and in which everyone of
English birth, from Royalty down, took&mdash;and ever
will take&mdash;a national pride; but, withal, few of
those amiabilities ever crop out in this great character
which make men loved. He can see a poor
priest culprit come to the rack without qualms;
and could look stolidly on, as Essex, his special
benefactor in his youth, walked to the scaffold; yet
the misstatement of a truth, with respect to physics,
or any matter about which truth or untruth was
clearly demonstrable, affected him like a galvanic
shock. His biographers, Montagu and Spedding,
have padded his angularities into roundness; while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
Pope and Macaulay have lashed him in the grave.
I think we must find the real man somewhere between
them; if we credit him with a great straight-thinking,
truth-seeking brain, and little or no capacity
for affection, the riddle of his strange life will
be more easily solved. Spedding,<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> who wrote a voluminous
life of Bacon&mdash;having devoted a quarter
of a century to necessary studies&mdash;does certainly
make disastrous ripping-up of the seams in Macaulay’s
rhetoric; but there remain certain ugly facts
relating to the trial of Essex, and the bribe-takings,
which will probably always keep alive in the popular
mind an under-current of distrust in respect to
the great Chancellor.</p>

<p>He was born in London, in 1561, three years before
Shakespeare, and at a time when, from his father’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
house in the Strand he could look sheer across
the Thames to Southwark, where, before he was
thirty, the Globe Theatre was built, in which Shakespeare
acted. He was in Paris when his father died;
there is no grief-stricken letter upon the event, but
a curious mention that he had dreamed two nights
before how his father’s house was covered with black
mortar&mdash;so intent is he on mental processes.</p>

<p>He had a mother who was pious, swift-thoughted,
jealous, imperious, unreasonable, with streaks of
tenderness.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Be not speedy of speech,” she says in one of her letters&mdash;“nor
talk suddenly, but when discretion requireth, and
that soberly then. Remember you have no father; and you
have little enough&mdash;if not too little, regarded your kind,
<em>no-simple</em> mother’s wholesome advice.”</p>

<p>And again: “Look well to your health; sup not, nor sit
not up late; surely I think your drinking near to bedtime
hindereth your and your brother’s digestion very much: I
never knew any but sickly that used it; besides ill for head
and eyes.” And again, in postscript: “I trust you, with yr
servants, use prayers twice in a day, having been where reformation
is. Omit it not for any.”</p>

</div>

<p>And he responds with ceremony, waiving much
of her excellent advice, and sometimes suggesting
some favor she can do him,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It may be I shall have occasion to visit the Court this
Vacation [he being then at Gray’s Inn], which I have not
done this months space. In which respect, because carriage
of stuff to and fro spoileth it, I would be glad of that
light bed of striped stuff which your Ladyship hath, if you
have not otherwise disposed it.”</p>

</div>

<p>Sharpish words, too, sometimes pass between
them; but he is always decorously and untouchingly
polite.</p>

<p>Indeed his protestations of undying friendship to
all of high station, whom he addresses unctuously,
are French in their amplitude, and French, too, in
their vanities. He presses sharply always toward
the great end of self-advancement&mdash;whether by
flatteries, or cajolement, or direct entreaty. He
believed in the survival of the fittest; and that the
fittest should struggle to make the survival good&mdash;no
matter what weak ones, or timid ones, or confiding
ones, or emotional ones should go to the wall,
or the bottom, in the struggle. His flatteries, I
think, never touched the Queen, though he tried
them often and gave a lurid color to his flatteries.
She admired his parts as a young man; she had
honored his father; she accepted his services with
thanks&mdash;even the dreadful services which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
rendered in demonstrating the treason of the gallant
and generous, but headstrong Earl of Essex.
He never came into full possession of royal confidences,
however, until James I. came to the throne:
by him he was knighted, by him made Lord Chancellor,
by him elevated to the peerage; and it was
under him that he was brought to trial for receiving
bribes&mdash;was convicted, despoiled of his judicial
robes, went to prison&mdash;though it might be only for
a day&mdash;and thereafter into that retirement, at once
shameful and honorable, where he put the last
touches to those broad teachings of “Philosophy,”
which the world will always cherish and revere:
not the first nor the last instance in which great
and fatal weaknesses have been united to great
power and great accomplishment.</p>

<p>But lest you may think too hardly of this eminent
man, a qualifying word must be said of that
stain upon him&mdash;of receiving bribes: it was no
uncommon thing for high judicial personages to
take gifts; no uncommon thing for all high officers
of the Government&mdash;nay, for the Government
itself, as typified in its supreme head. And,
strange as it may seem, Bacon’s sense of justice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
does not appear to have been swayed by the gifts
he took. Spedding has demonstrated, I think,
that no judgment he rendered was ever reversed by
subsequent and farther hearing.<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> He was not in
the ordinary sense a money-lover; but he did love
the importance and consideration which money
gave, yet was always in straits; and those unwise
receivings of his went to supply the shortcomings
in a very extravagant and disorderly
home-life. His servants plundered him; his
tradespeople fleeced him; nor do I think that the
mistress of the Chancellor’s household was either
very wary or very winning. Almost the only
time there is mention of her in his letters occurs
previous to his marriage (which did not take
place till he was well in middle age), and then
only as “the daughter of an alderman who will
bring a good dot” with her. His mother-in-law,
too, appears to have been of the stage sort of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
mother-in-law, whom he addresses (by letter) in
this fashion:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Madam,” he says, “you shall with right good-will be
made acquainted with anything that concerneth your daughters,
if you bear a mind of love and concord: Otherwise
you must be content to be a stranger to us. For I may not
be so unwise as to suffer you to be an author or occasion of
dissension between your daughters and their husbands;
having seen so much misery of that kind in yourself.”</p>

</div>

<p>This looks a little as if the mother-in-law found
the “grapes sour” in the Bacon gardens. I do not
think there was much domesticity about him, even
if home influences had encouraged it: he was without
children, and not one to read poetry to his wife
in a boudoir; yet his essays concerning marriage
and concerning children and concerning friendship
and concerning extravagance, are full of piquant
truths.</p>

<p>Indeed two distinct lines of life ran through the
career of this extraordinary man. In one he loved
parade, ceremony, glitter; he stooped ungraciously
to those who ranked him in factitious distinctions;
was profuse and heartless in his adulation;
taking great gifts with servile acknowledgment;
shunning friends who were falling; courting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
enemies who were rising: and yet through all
this, and looking out from the same keen inscrutable
eyes was the soul of a philosopher cognizant
of all humanities, searching sharply after the largest
and broadest truths; too indifferent to small ones;
weighing his own shortcomings with bitter remorse;
alive to everything in science that should
help the advancement of the world, and absorbed in
high ranges of thinking which the animosities and
cares and criminalities and accidents of every-day
life did not seem to reach or to disturb.</p>

<p>In such mood he wrote those essays, of some
of which I have spoken&mdash;wonderfully compact of
thought, and as wonderfully compact of language&mdash;which
one should read and read again. No private
library of a hundred English books is complete
without a copy of Bacon’s Essays. The keen sagacity
and perdurable sense of his observations always
engage one. Thus of Travel, he says,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Let him [the Traveller] sequester himself from the
company of his countrymen, and diet in such places where
there is good company of the nation where he travelleth.
He that travelleth into a country before he hath some entrance
into the language, goeth to school and not to travel.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Of Friendship:&mdash;“This communicating of a man’s self to
his friend, works two contrary efforts; for it redoubleth
joys and cutteth griefs in halves.” Again, of the advantages
of talk with a friend:&mdash;“Certain it is, that whosoever hath
his mind fraught with many thoughts, his wits and understanding
do clarify and break up, in the communicating
and discoursing with another; he tosseth his thoughts more
easily; he marshalleth them more orderly; he seeth how
they look when they are turned into words; finally, he
waxeth wiser than himself: and that more by an hours discourse
than by a days meditation.”</p>

</div>

<p>Thus I could go on for page after page of citations
which you would approve, and which are
so put in words that no mending or shortening or
deepening of their force seems anyway possible.
And yet this book of Essays&mdash;with all its sagacities,
its ringing terseness, its stanch worldly wisdom&mdash;is
one we do not warm toward. Even when he
talks of friendship or marriage, death or love, a
cold line of self-seeking pervades it. Of sacrifice
for love’s sake, for friendship’s sake, or for charity’s
sake, there is nothing; and in that Essay on
“Parents and Children”&mdash;what iciness of reflection&mdash;of
suggestion! A man might talk as Bacon talks
there, of the entries in a “Herd-book.”</p>

<p>As for the <cite>Novum Organum</cite> and the <cite>Augmentis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
Scientiarum</cite>&mdash;you would not read them if I were
to suggest it: indeed, there is no need for reading
them, except as a literary <i lang="la">excursus</i>, seeing that
they have wrought their work in breaking up old,
slow modes of massing knowledge, and in pouring
light upon new ways;&mdash;in serving, indeed, so far
as their reach went, as a great logical lever, by
which subsequent inquirers have prised up a thousand
hidden knowledges and ways of knowledge to
the comprehension and cognizance of the world.</p>

<p>And the two lines of life in Francis Bacon were
joined by a strange hyphen at last: He got out of
his coach (which was not paid for), and in his silk
stockings walked through the snow, to prosecute
some scientific post-mortem experiment upon the
body of a chicken he had secured by the roadside,
near to London. He caught cold&mdash;as lesser men
would have done; and he died of it. This date of
his death (1626) brings us beyond Elizabeth’s time&mdash;beyond
James’ time, too, and far down to the
early years of Charles I. He was born, as I said,
three years before Shakespeare, three years after
Elizabeth came to the throne; and the <cite>Novum
Organum</cite> was published in the same year in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth Rock&mdash;a convenient
peg on which to hang the date of two great
events.</p>

<p>He was buried in the old town of St. Alban’s, of
whose antiquities I have already spoken, and near
to which Gorhambury, the country home of Bacon,
was situated. The town and region are well worth
a visit: and it is one of the few spots whither one
can still go by a well-appointed English stage-coach
with sleek horses&mdash;four-in-hand, which starts every
morning in summer from the White Horse Cellar,
in Piccadilly, and spins over the twenty miles of intervening
beautiful road (much of it identical with
the old Roman Watling Street) in less than two
hours and a half. The drive is through Middlesex,
and into “pleasant Hertfordshire,” where the huge
Norman tower of the old abbey buildings, rising
from the left bank of the Ver, marks the town of St.
Alban’s. The tomb and monument of Bacon are in
the Church of St. Michael’s: there is still an Earl of
Verulam presiding over a new Gorhambury House;
and thereabout, one may find remnants of the old
home of the great Chancellor and some portion of
the noble gardens in which he took so much delight,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
and in which he wandered up and down, in
peaked hat and in ruff, and with staff&mdash;pondering
affairs of State&mdash;possibly meditating the while
upon that most curious and stately Essay of his
upon “Gardens,” which opens thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“God Almighty first planted a garden. And, indeed, it is
the purest of human pleasures. It is the greatest refreshment
to the spirits of man, without which building and
palaces are but gross handyworks: and a man shall ever
see, that when ages grow to civility and elegancy, men come
to build stately, sooner than to garden finely; as if gardening
were the greater perfection.”</p>

</div>

<p>Surely, we who grow our own salads and “graff”
our own pear-trees may take exaltation from this:
and yet I do not believe that the great Chancellor
ever put his hand, laboringly, to a rake-stave: but
none the less, he snuffed complacently the odor of
his musk-roses and his eglantine, and looked admiringly
at his clipped walls of hedges.</p>

<h3>Thomas Hobbes.</h3>

<p>There used to come sometimes to these gardens
of Gorhambury, in Bacon’s day, a young man&mdash;twenty
years his junior&mdash;of a strangely subtle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
mind, who caught so readily at the great Chancellor’s
meaning, and was otherwise so well instructed
that he was employed by him in some clerical duties.
His name was Thomas Hobbes; and it is a name
that should be known and remembered, because it
is identified with writings which had as much influence
upon the current of thought in the middle of
the next century (the seventeenth) as those of Herbert
Spencer have now, and for somewhat similar
reasons. He was a very free thinker, as well as a
deep one; keeping, from motives of policy, nominally
within Church lines, yet abhorred and disavowed
by Church-teachers; believing in the absolute right
of kings, and in self-interest as the nucleus of all
good and successful schemes for the conduct of life;
weighing relations to the future and a Supreme
Good (if existing) with a trader’s prudence, and
counting Friendship “a sense of social utility.”
His theory of government was&mdash;a crystallization of
forces, coming about regularly by the prudent self-seeking
of individuals. Of divine or spiritual influences
he does not take any sympathetic cognizance;
hard, cold, calculating; not inspiring, not hopeful;
feeding higher appetites on metaphysic husks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>Of his Deism I give this exhibit:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Forasmuch as God Almighty is incomprehensible, it followeth
that we can have no conception or image of the
Deity; and consequently, all his attributes signify our inability
and defect of power to conceive anything concerning his
nature, and not any conception of the same, except only this&mdash;that
there is a God. For the effects, we acknowledge
naturally, do include a power of their producing, before
they were produced; and that power presupposeth something
existent that hath such power: and the thing so existing
with power to produce, if it were not eternal, must
needs have been produced by somewhat before it; and that,
again, by something else before that, till we come to an
eternal (that is to say, the first) Power of all Powers, and
first Cause of all Causes; and this is it which all men conceive
by the name <span class="smcap">God</span>, implying eternity, incomprehensibility,
and omnipotency. And thus all that will consider may
know that God is, though not <em>what</em> he is.”</p>

</div>

<p>Cribbing his emotional nature (if he ever had
any), he yet writes with wonderful directness, perspicacity,
and <em>verve</em>&mdash;making “Hobbism” talked
of, as Spencerism is talked of. Indeed, one does
not see clearly how any man, flinging only his bare
hook of logic and his sinker of reason into the infinite
depths around us, can fish up anything of a
helpfully spiritual sort much better than Hobbism
now.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>He was specially befriended by the Cavendishes,
having once been tutor to a younger scion
of that distinguished family; and so he came to
pass his latest years in their princely home of
Chatsworth, humored by the Duke, and treated by
the Duchess as a pet bear&mdash;to be regularly fed
and not provoked; climbing the Derbyshire hills of
a morning, dining at mid-day, and at candle-lighting
retiring to his private room to smoke his twelve
pipes of tobacco (his usual allowance) and to follow
through the smoke his winding trails of thought.<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

<p>He lived to the extreme age of ninety-two, thus
coming well down into the times of Charles II.,
who used to say of him that “he was a bear against
whom the Church played her young dogs to exercise
them.” He lived and died a bachelor, not relishing
society in general, and liking only such
shrewd acute friends as could track him in his
subtleties, who had the grace to applaud him, and
the wise policy of concealing their antagonisms.</p>

<p>He is not much cited now in books, nor has his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
name association with any of those felicities of literature
which exude perennial perfumes. He was
careless of graces; he stirred multitudes into new
trains of thought; he fed none of them with any of
the minor and gracious delights of learning. Perhaps
he is best known in literary ways proper by a
close and lucid translation of the <cite>History</cite> of Thucydides,
which I believe is still reckoned by scholars
a good rendering of the Greek.<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<p>He ventured, too, upon verse in praise of Derbyshire
and of the valley of the Derwent, but it is
not rich or beautiful. A man who keeps his emotional
nature in a strait-jacket&mdash;for security or for
other purpose&mdash;may make catalogues of trees, or
of summer days; but he cannot paint the lilies or
a sunrise. A translation of Homer which he undertook
and accomplished, when over eighty, was just
as far from a success, and for kindred reasons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<h3>George Chapman.</h3>

<p>There was, however, another translation of Homer
about those times, or a little earlier, which was of
much rarer quality, and which has not lost its rare
flavors even now. I speak of George Chapman’s.
It is not so true to the Greek as Hobbes’ Thucydides;
indeed not true at all to the words, but true
to the spirit; and in passages where the translator’s
zeal was aflame catching more of the dash, and
abounding flow, and brazen resonance of the old
Greek poet than Pope, or Cowper, Derby, or Bryant.</p>

<p>The literalists will never like him, of course; he
drops words that worry him&mdash;whole lines indeed
with which he does not choose to grapple; he adds
words, too&mdash;whole lines, scenes almost; there is
vulgarity sometimes, and coarseness; he calls things
by their old homely names; there is no fine talk
about the chest or the abdomen, but the Greek
lances drive straight through the ribs or to the
navel, and if a cut be clean and large&mdash;we are not
told of crimson tides&mdash;but the blood gurgles out
in great gouts as in a slaughter-house; there may
be over-plainness, and over-heat, and over-stress;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
but nowhere weakness; and his unwieldly, staggering
lines&mdash;fourteen syllables long&mdash;forge on
through the ruts which the Homeric chariots have
worn, bouncing and heaving and plunging and jolting,
but always lunging forward with their great
burden of battle, of brazen shields, and ponderous
war-gods. I hardly know where to cut into the
welter of his long lines for sample, but in all parts
his brawny pen declares itself. Take a bit from
that skrimmage of the Sixteenth Book where&mdash;</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>What a description this old Chapman would have
made of a tug at foot-ball!</p>

<p>Another fragment I take from the Twenty-first
Book, where the River God roars and rages in the
waters of Scamander against Achilles:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="verse">&mdash;&mdash;“Then swell’d his waves, then rag’d, then boil’d again</div>

<div class="verse">About Achilles. On his shield the violence of the Flood</div>
<div class="verse">Beat so, it drove him back, and took his feet up, his fair palm</div>
<div class="verse">Enforc’d to catch into his stay a broad and lofty elm,</div>
<div class="verse">Whose roots he tossed up with his hold, and tore up all the shore.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p>When any of us can make as spirited a translation
as that, I think we can stand a scolding from
the teachers for not being literal. George Chapman
lived a very long life, and did other things
worthily; wrote a mass of dramas<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>&mdash;but not of
the very best; they belong to the class of plays
those people talk of who want to talk of things
nobody has read. I think better and richer things
are before us.</p>

<h3>Marlowe.</h3>

<p>Did it ever happen to you to read upon a summer’s
day that delightful old book&mdash;of a half century
later&mdash;called <cite>The Complete Angler</cite>; and do
you remember how, on a certain evening when
the quiet Angler had beguiled himself with loitering
under beech-trees and watching the lambs and
listening to the birds, he did encounter, in an adjoining
field, a handsome milkmaid, who lifted up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
her voice&mdash;which was like a nightingale’s&mdash;to an
old-fashioned song, beginning?&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Come live with me and be my love,</div>
<div class="verse">And we will all the pleasures prove</div>
<div class="verse">That valleys, groves, or hills, or field</div>
<div class="verse">Or woods, or steepy mountains yield&mdash;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">And I will make thee beds of roses</div>
<div class="verse">And then a thousand fragrant posies</div>
<div class="verse">A cap of flowers and a kirtle</div>
<div class="verse">Embroidered all with leaves of myrtle.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Well, that song of the milkmaid, with its setting
of verdant meads and silver streams and honeysuckle
hedges keeps singing itself in a great many
ears to-day: And it was written by Christopher
Marlowe,<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> one of the most harum-scarum young
dare-devils of Elizabethan times. He was born in
the same year with Shakespeare&mdash;down in Canterbury,
or near by (whither we saw St. Augustine
carrying Christian crosses)&mdash;was son of a shoemaker
who lived thereabout, yet came somehow to
be a Cambridge man, drifted thereafter to London&mdash;full
of wit and words of wantonness; developing
early; known for a tragedy that caught the ear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
of the town six years before Shakespeare had published
the “Venus and Adonis.” He was an actor,
too, as so many of the dramatic wits of that day
were&mdash;maybe upon the same boards where Shakespeare
was then certainly a mender, if not a maker
of parts. Did they hobnob together? Did they
compare plots? If we only knew: but we do not.</p>

<p>The critics of the days closely succeeding said
he would have rivalled Shakespeare if he had lived:
Doubtless he would have brought more learning
to the rivalry; perhaps an equal wit&mdash;maybe an
even greater rhythmic faculty and as dauntless
and daring imaginative power; but dignity and
poise of character were not in him. He died&mdash;stabbed&mdash;in
a drunken brawl before he was thirty.<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>
In his tragedies&mdash;if you read them&mdash;you will find
the beat and flow and rhythm&mdash;to which a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
many of the best succeeding English tragedies were
attuned. He scored first upon British theatre-walls,
with fingers made tremulous by tavern orgies,
a great sampler of dramatic story, by which scores
of succeeding play-writers set their copy; but into
these copies many and many a one of lesser power
put a grace, a tenderness, and a dignity which never
belonged to the half-crazed and short-lived Marlowe.
You will remember him best perhaps as the
author of the pleasant little madrigal of which I
cited a verselet; and if you value the delicatest of
description, you will relish still more his unfinished
version of the Greek story of “Hero and Leander”&mdash;a
pregnant line of which&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“who ever loved that loved not at first sight”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;has the abiding honor of having been quoted by
Shakespeare in his play of “As You Like It.”</p>

<p>I leave Marlowe&mdash;citing first a beautiful bit of
descriptive verse from his “Hero and Leander:”&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“At Sestos Hero dwelt: Hero the fair,</div>
<div class="verse">Whom young Apollo courted for her hair,</div>

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Upon her head she wore a myrtle wreath</div>
<div class="verse">From thence her veil reached to the ground beneath;</div>
<div class="verse">Her veil was artificial flowers and leaves,</div>
<div class="verse">Whose workmanship both man and beast deceives;</div>
<div class="verse">Many would praise the sweet smell, as she past,</div>
<div class="verse">When ’twas the odor that her breath forth cast;</div>
<div class="verse">And there<em>for</em> honey-bees have sought in vain</div>
<div class="verse">And beat from thence, have lighted there again.</div>
<div class="verse">About her neck hung chains of pebble stone,</div>
<div class="verse">Which, lighted by her neck, like diamonds shone.</div>
<div class="verse">She wore no gloves; for neither sun nor wind</div>
<div class="verse">Would burn or parch her hands, but, to her mind;</div>
<div class="verse">Or warm, or cool them; for they took delight</div>
<div class="verse">To play upon those hands, they were so white.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Some say, for her the fairest Cupid pin’d</div>
<div class="verse">And, looking in her face, was strooken blind.</div>
<div class="verse">But this is true; so like was one the other,</div>
<div class="verse">As he imagined Hero was his mother:</div>
<div class="verse">And often-times into her bosom flew,</div>
<div class="verse">About her naked neck his bare arms threw,</div>
<div class="verse">And laid his childish head upon her breast</div>
<div class="verse">And, with still panting rock’t, there took his rest.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>I think all will agree that this is very delicately
done.</p>

<h3>A Tavern Coterie.</h3>

<p>But let us not forget where we are, and where we
are finding such men and such poems: we are in
London and are close upon the end of the sixteenth
century; there are no morning newspapers; these
came long afterward; but the story of such a death
as that of Marlowe, stabbed in the eye&mdash;maybe
by his own dagger&mdash;would spread from tongue to
tongue; (possibly one of his horrific dramas had
been played that very day): certainly the knowledge
of it would come quick to all his boon friends&mdash;actors,
writers, wits&mdash;who were used to meet, maybe
at the Falcon on Bankside, or possibly at the Mermaid
Tavern.</p>

<p>This Mermaid Tavern was a famous place in
those and in succeeding days. It stood on Cheapside
(between Friday and Bread Streets) gorgeous
with three ranges of Elizabethan windows, that
gave look-out upon an array of goldsmiths’ shops
which shone across the way. It was almost in the
shadow of the Church of St. Mary le Bow, burned
in the great fire, but having its representative
tower and spire&mdash;a good work of Christopher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
Wren&mdash;standing thereabout in our time, and still
holding out its clock over the sidewalk.</p>

<p>And the literary friends who would have gathered
in such a place to talk over the sad happening to
Kit Marlowe are those whom it behoves us to
know, at least by name. There, surely would be
Thomas Lodge,<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> who was concerned in the writing
of plays; wrote, too, much to his honor, a certain
novel (if we may call it so) entitled <cite>Rosalynde</cite>,
from which Shakespeare took the hint and much
of the pleasant machinery for his delightful drama
of “As You Like It.” This Lodge was in his youth
hail fellow with actors who gathered at taverns;
and&mdash;if not actor himself&mdash;was certainly a lover
of their wild ways and their feastings. He admired
<cite>Euphues</cite> overmuch, was disposed to literary affectations
and alliteration&mdash;writing, amongst other
things, <cite>A Nettle for Nice Noses</cite>. He was, too, a
man of the world and wide traveller; voyaged
with Cavendish, and was said to be engaged in a
British raid upon the Canaries. In later years he
became a physician of soberly habits and much
credit, dying of the plague in 1625.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>Nashe<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> also would have been good mate-fellow
with Marlowe; a Cambridge man this&mdash;though
possibly “weaned before his time;” certainly most
outspoken, hard to govern, quick-witted, fearless,
flinging his fiery word-darts where he would.
Gabriel Harvey, that priggish patron of Spenser,
to whom I have alluded, found this to his cost.
Indeed this satirist came to have the name of the
English Aretino&mdash;as sharp as he, and as wild-living,
and wild-loving as he.</p>

<p>Nashe was a native of Lowestoft, on the easternmost
point of English shore, in Suffolk, not far
from those potteries (of Gurton) whose old quaint
products collectors still seek for and value. Dr.
Grosart, in the Huth Library, has built a wordy
monument to his memory; we do not say it is undeserved;
certainly he had a full brain, great readiness,
graphic power, and deep love for his friends.
Like Lodge, he travelled: like him took to his
wits to pay tavern bills; a sharp fellow every way.
He lent a hand, and a strong one, to that tedious,
noisy, brawling ecclesiastic controversy of his day&mdash;called
the <em>Mar-Prelate</em> one; a controversy full of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
a great swash of those prickly, sharp-tasted, biting
words&mdash;too often belonging to church quarrels&mdash;and
which men hardly approach for comment, even
in our time, without getting themselves pricked by
contact into wrathful splutter of ungracious language.</p>

<p>One may get a true taste (and I think a surfeit)
of his exuberance in epithet, and of his coarse but
rasping raillery in his <cite>Pierce Penilesse</cite>. Here is
one of his pleasant lunges at some “Latinless”
critic:&mdash;“Let a scholar write and he says&mdash;‘Tush,
I like not these common fellows’; let him write
well, and he says&mdash;‘Tush, it’s stolen out of some
book.’”</p>

<p>Then there was Robert Greene<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>&mdash;a Reverend,
but used to tavern gatherings, and whose story is a
melancholy one, and worth a little more than mere
mention. He was a man of excellent family, well
nurtured, as times went; native of the old city of
Norwich, in Norfolk; probably something older
than either Marlowe or Shakespeare; studied at St.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
John’s, Cambridge&mdash;“amongst wags”&mdash;he says
in his <cite>Repentance</cite>&mdash;“as lewd as myself;” was a
clergyman (after a sort); pretty certainly had a
church at one time; married a charming wife in
the country, but going up to that maelstrom of
London fell into all evil ways: wrote little poems
a saint might have written, and cracked jokes with
his tongue that would make a saint shudder; deserted
his wife and child; became a red-bearded
bully, raging in the taverns, with unkempt hair:
Yet even thus and there (as if all England in
those Elizabethan times bloomed with lilies and
lush roses, which lent their perfume to all verse
the vilest might write) inditing poems having
a tender pathos, which will live. Take these
verselets for instance; and as you read them, remember
that he had deserted his pure, fond, loving
wife and his prattling boy, and was more deeply
sunk in ways of debauchery than any of his fellows;
’tis a mother’s song to her child:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Weep not, my wanton, smile upon my knee,</div>
<div class="verse">When thou art old, there’s grief enough for thee.</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Streaming tears that never stint,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Like pearl-drops from a flint,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
<div class="verse indent2">Fell by course from his eyes,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">That one another’s place supplies.</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Thus he grieved in every part,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Tears of blood fell from his heart</div>
<div class="verse indent2">When he left his pretty boy,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Father’s sorrow&mdash;father’s joy.</div>
<div class="verse indent2">The wanton smiled, father wept,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Mother cried, baby leapt;</div>
<div class="verse indent2">More he crowed more we cried,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Nature could not sorrow hide;</div>
<div class="verse indent2">He must go, he must kiss</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Child and mother&mdash;baby bless&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse indent2">For he left his pretty boy,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Father’s sorrow, father’s joy.</div>
<div class="verse">Weep not, my wanton, smile upon my knee,</div>
<div class="verse">When thou art old, there’s grief enough for thee.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And the poet who wrote this&mdash;putting tenderness
into poems of the affections, and a glowing
color into pastoral verse, and point and delicacy
into his prose&mdash;wrote also <cite>A Groates worth of Wit,
bought with a Million of Repentance</cite>, and he died of a
surfeit of pickled herring and Rhenish wine.</p>

<p>In that ‘Groat’s worth of Wit’ (published after
his death) there is a memorable line or two&mdash;being
probably the first contemporary notice of
Shakespeare that still has currency; and it is in
the form of a gibe:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“There is an upstart crow, beautified with our feathers,
that with his Tygres heart wrapt in a players hide, supposes
hee is as well able to bombast out a blanke-verse as the best
of you; and, being an absolute Johannes-fac-totum, is in
his owne conceyt the onely Shake-Scene in a countrey.”</p>

</div>

<p>How drolly it sounds&mdash;to hear this fine fellow,
broken up with drink and all bedevilments, making
his envious lunge at the great master who has perhaps
worried him by theft of some of his dramatic
methods or schemes, and who gives to poor Greene
one of his largest titles to fame in having been the
subject of his lampoon!</p>

<p>It gives added importance, too, to this gibe, to
know that it was penned when the writer, impoverished,
diseased, deserted by patrons, saw death
fronting him; and it gives one’s heart a wrench to
read how this debauched poet&mdash;whose work has
given some of the best color to the “Winter’s Tale”
of Shakespeare&mdash;writes with faltering hand, begging
his “gentle” wife’s forgiveness, and that she
would see that the charitable host, who has taken
him in, for his last illness, shall suffer no loss&mdash;then,
toying with the sheets, and “babbling o’
green fields,” he dies.</p>

<p>Keen critics of somewhat later days said Shakespeare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
had Greene’s death in mind when he told
the story of Falstaff’s.</p>

<p>It is quite possible that all these men I have
named will have encountered, off and on, at their
tavern gatherings, the lithe, youngish fellow, large
browed and with flashing eyes, who loves Rhenish
too in a way, but who loves the altitudes of poetic
thought better; who is just beginning to be known
poet-wise by his “Venus and Adonis”&mdash;whose
name is William Shakespeare&mdash;and who has great
aptitude at fixing a play, whether his own or another
man’s; and with Burbage for the leading
parts, can make them take wonderfully well.</p>

<p>Possibly, too, in these tavern gatherings would
be the young, boyish Earl of Southampton, who is
associated with some of the many enigmas respecting
Shakespeare’s Sonnets, and whom we Americans
ought to know of, because he became interested
thereafter in schemes for colonizing Virginia,
and has left his name of Southampton to one of
the Virginia counties; and, still better, is associated
with that beautiful reach of the Chesapeake
waters which we now call “Hampton Roads.”</p>

<p>In that company too&mdash;familiar with London<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
taverns in later Elizabethan years&mdash;the beefy Ben
Jonson was sure to appear, with his great shag
of hair, and his fine eye, and his coarse lip, bubbling
over with wit and with Latin: he, quite
young as yet; perhaps just now up from Cambridge;
ten years the junior of Shakespeare; and
yet by his bulky figure and doughty air dominating
his elders, and sure to call the attention of all idlers
who hung about the doors of the Mermaid. He
may be even now plotting his first play of “Every
Man in his Humour,” or that new club of his and
Raleigh’s devising, which is to have its meeting of
jolly fellows in the same old Cheapside tavern, and
to make its rafters shake with their uproarious
mirth. For the present we leave them all there&mdash;with
a May sun struggling through London fogs, and
gleaming by fits and starts upon the long range of
jewellers’ shops, for which Cheapside was famous&mdash;upon
the White Cross and Conduit, whereat the shop-girls
are filling their pails&mdash;upon the great country
wains coming in by Whitechapel Road&mdash;upon the tall
spire of St. Mary le Bow, and upon the diamond panes
of the Mermaid tavern, to whose recesses we have
just seen the burly figure of Ben Jonson swagger in.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<p class="dropcap">In opening the preceding chapter I spoke of
that dainty John Lyly, who first set a fashion
in letters, and whose daintiness hid much of the
strength and cleverness that were in him: I spoke
of the wonderful twin development of the Lord
Chancellor Bacon&mdash;selfish and ignoble as a man,
serene and exalted as a philosopher; and I tried to
fasten in the reader’s mind the locality of his tomb
and home at the old town of St. Alban’s&mdash;a short
coach-ride away from London, down in “pleasant
Hertfordshire:” I spoke of Hobbes (somewhat before
his turn) whose free-thinking&mdash;of great influence
in its day, and the sharply succeeding days&mdash;is
supplemented by more acute and subtle, if not
more far-reaching, free-thinking now. I quoted the
Homer of Chapman, under whose long and staggering
lines there burned always true Homeric fire.
I cited Marlowe, because his youth and power<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
promised so much, and the promise so soon ended
in an early and inglorious death. Then came
Lodge, Nashe, and Greene, mates of Marlowe, all
well-bred, all having an itch for penwork, and some
of them for the stage; all making rendezvous&mdash;what
time they were in London&mdash;at some tavern
of Bankside, or at the Mermaid, where we caught a
quick glimpse of Ben Jonson, and another of the
Stratford player.</p>

<h3>George Peele.</h3>

<p>I might, however, have added to the lesser names
that decorated the closing years of the sixteenth
century that of George Peele,<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> of Devonshire
birth, but, like so many of his fellows, a university
man: he came to be a favorite in London; loved
taverns and wine as unwisely as Greene; was said
to have great tact for the ordering of showy pageants;
did win upon Queen Elizabeth by his “Arraignment
of Paris” (half masque and half play)
represented by the children of the Chapel Royal&mdash;and
carrying luscious flattery to the ready ears of
Eliza, Queen of&mdash;</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Yet even such praises did not keep poor Peele
from hard fare and a stinging lack of money.</p>

<p>“An Old Wives Tale,” which he wrote, has conjurers
and dragons in it, with odd twists of language
which remind one of the kindred and nonsensical
jingle of “Patience” or “Pinafore:”&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>This play is further notable for having supplied
much of the motive for the machinery and movement
of Milton’s noble poem of <cite>Comus</cite>. It is
worth one’s while to compare the two. Of course
Peele will suffer&mdash;as those who make beginnings
always do.</p>

<p>This writer is said to have been sometime a
shareholder with Shakespeare in the Blackfriars
Theatre; he was an actor, too, like his great contemporary;
and besides the plays which carried a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
wordy bounce in them, wrote a very tender scriptural
drama about King David and the fair Bethsabe,
with charming quotable things in it. Thus&mdash;</p>

<h3>Thomas Dekker.</h3>

<p>Dekker was fellow of Peele and of the rest;<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> he
quarrelled bitterly with Ben Jonson&mdash;they beating
each other vilely with bad words, that can be read
now (by whoso likes such reading) in the <cite>Poetaster</cite>
of Jonson, or in the <cite>Satiromastix</cite> of Dekker.
’Twould be unfair, however, to judge him altogether
by his play of the cudgels in this famous controversy.
There is good meat in what Dekker wrote:
he had humor; he had pluck; he had gift for using
words&mdash;to sting or to praise&mdash;or to beguile
one. There are traces not only of a Dickens flavor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
in him, but of a Lamb flavor as well; and there is
reason to believe that, like both these later humorists,
he made his conquests without the support
of a university training. Swinburne characterizes
him as a “modest, shiftless, careless nature:” but
he was keen to thrust a pin into one who had offended
his sensibilities; in his plays he warmed
into pretty lyrical outbreaks, but never seriously
measured out a work of large proportions, or entered
upon execution of such with a calm, persevering
temper. He was many-sided, not only literary-wise,
but also conscience-wise. It seems incredible
that one who should write the coarse things which
appear in his <cite>Bachelor’s Banquet</cite> should also have
elaborated, with a pious unction (that reminds
of Jeremy Taylor) the saintly invocations of the
<cite>Foure Birds of Noah’s Ark</cite>: and as for his <cite>Dreame</cite>
it shows in parts a luridness of color which reminds
of our own Wigglesworth&mdash;as if this
New England poet of fifty years later may have
dipped his brush into the same paint-pot. I cite
a warm fragment from his <cite>Dreame of the Last Judgement</cite>;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Their cries, nor yelling did the Judge regard,</div>
<div class="verse">For all the doores of Mercy up were bar’d:</div>
<div class="verse">Justice and Wrath in wrinkles knit his forhead,</div>
<div class="verse">And thus he spake: You cursed and abhorred,</div>
<div class="verse">You brood of Sathan, sonnes of death and hell,</div>
<div class="verse">In fires that still shall burne, you still shall dwell;</div>
<div class="verse">In hoopes of Iron: then were they bound up strong,</div>
<div class="verse">(Shrikes [shrieks] being the Burden of their dolefull song)</div>
<div class="verse">Scarce was Sentence breath’d-out, but mine eies</div>
<div class="verse">Even saw (me thought) a Caldron, whence did rise</div>
<div class="verse">A pitchy Steeme of Sulphure and thick Smoake,</div>
<div class="verse">Able whole coapes of Firmament to choake:</div>
<div class="verse">About this, Divels stood round, still blowing the fire,</div>
<div class="verse">Some, tossing Soules, some whipping them with wire,</div>
<div class="verse">Across the face, as up to th’ chins they stood</div>
<div class="verse">In boyling brimstone, lead and oyle, and bloud.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It is, however, as a social photographer that I
wish to call special attention to Dekker; indeed, his
little touches upon dress, dinners, bear-baitings,
watermen, walks at <em>Powles</em>, Spanish boots, tavern
orgies&mdash;though largely ironical and much exaggerated
doubtless, have the same elements of nature
in them which people catch now with their
pocket detective cameras. His <cite>Sinnes of London</cite>,
his answer to <cite>Pierce Pennilesse</cite>, his <cite>Gull’s Horne
Boke</cite> are full of these sketches. This which follows,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
tells how a young gallant should behave himself
in an ordinary:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Being arrived in the room, salute not any but those of
your acquaintance; walke up and downe by the rest as
scornfully and as carelessly as a Gentleman-Usher: Select
some friend (having first throwne off your cloake) to walke
up and downe the roome with you, … and this will
be a meanes to publish your clothes better than Powles, a
Tennis-court, or a Playhouse; discourse as lowd as you can,
no matter to what purpose if you but make a noise, and
laugh in fashion, and have a good sower face to promise
quarrelling, you shall be much observed.</p>

<p>“If you be a souldier, talke how often you have beene in
action: as the <em>Portingale</em> voiage, Cales voiage, besides some
eight or nine imploiments in Ireland.… And if you
perceive that the untravellᵈ Company about you take this
doune well, ply them with more such stuffe, as how you
have interpreted betweene the French king and a great Lord
of Barbary, when they have been drinking healthes together,
and that will be an excellent occasion to publish your languages,
if you have them: if not, get some fragments of
French, or smal parcels of Italian, to fling about the table:
but beware how you speake any Latine there.”</p>

</div>

<p>And he goes on to speak of the three-penny tables
and the twelve-penny tables, and of the order
in which meats should be eaten&mdash;all which as giving
glimpses of something like the every-day, actual
life of the ambitious and the talked-of young fellows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
about London streets and taverns is better
worth to us than Dekker’s dramas.</p>

<h3>Michael Drayton.</h3>

<p>We encounter next a personage of a different
stamp, and one who, very likely, would have shaken
his head in sage disapproval of the flippant advices
of Dekker; I refer to Michael Drayton,<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> who wrote
enormously in verse upon all imaginable subjects;
there are elegiacs, canzonets, and fables; there are
eclogues, and heroic epistles and legends and
<cite>Nimphidia</cite> and sonnets. He tells of the Barons’
Wars, of the miseries of Queen Margaret, of how
David killed Goliath, of Moses in the burning bush&mdash;in
lines counting by thousands; <cite>Paradise Lost</cite>
stretched six times over would not equal his pile
of print; and all the verse that Goldsmith ever
wrote, compared with Drayton’s portentous mass
would seem like an iridescent bit of cockle-shell
upon a sea of ink. This protracting writer was a
Warwickshire man&mdash;not a far-off countryman of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
Shakespeare, and a year only his senior; a respectable
personage, not joining in tavern bouts, caring
for himself and living a long life. His great poem
of <cite>Poly-olbion</cite> many know by name, and very few, I
think, of this generation ever read through. It is
about the mountains, rivers, wonders, pleasures,
flowers, trees, stories, and antiquities of England;
and it is twenty thousand lines long, and every line
a long Alexandrine. Yet there are pictures and
prettinesses in it, which properly segregated and
detached from the wordy trails which go before and
after them, would make the fortune of a small poet.
There are descriptions in it, valuable for their utter
fidelity and a fulness of nomenclature which keeps
alive pleasantly ancient names. Here, for instance,
is a summing up of old English wild-flowers, where,
in his quaint way, he celebrates the nuptials of the
river Thames (who is groom) with the bridal Isis,
that flows by Oxford towers. It begins at the one
hundred and fiftieth line of the fifteenth song of the
fiftieth part:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“The Primrose placing first, because that in the Spring</div>
<div class="verse">It is the first appears, then only flourishing;</div>
<div class="verse">The azuréd Hare-bell next, with them they gently mix’d</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
<div class="verse">T’ allay whose luscious smell, they Woodbine plac’d betwixt;</div>
<div class="verse">Amongst those things of scent, there prick they in the Lily,</div>
<div class="verse">And near to that again, her sister&mdash;Daffodilly</div>
<div class="verse">To sort these flowers of show, with th’ other that were so sweet,</div>
<div class="verse">The Cowslip then they couch, and the Oxlip, for her meet;</div>
<div class="verse">The Columbine amongst, they sparingly do set,</div>
<div class="verse">The yellow King-cup wrought in many a curious fret;</div>
<div class="verse">And now and then among, of Eglantine a spray,</div>
<div class="verse">By which again a course of Lady-smocks they lay;</div>
<div class="verse">The Crow-flower, and thereby the Clover-flower they stick,</div>
<div class="verse">The Daisy over all those sundry sweets so thick.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The garden-flowers follow in equal fulness of
array; and get an even better setting in one of his
Nymphals, where they are garlanded about the
head of Tita; and in these pretty Nymphals, and
still more in the airy, fairy <cite>Nymphidia</cite>&mdash;with their
elfins and crickets and butterflies, one will get an
earlier smack of our own “Culprit Fay.” Those who
love the scents of ancient garden-grounds&mdash;as we
do&mdash;will relish the traces of garden love in this old
Warwickshire man. In his Heroic Epistles, too,
one will find a mastership of ringing couplets: and
there are spirit and dash in that clanging battle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
ode of his which sets forth the honors and the
daring of Agincourt. Its martial echoes&mdash;kept
alive by Campbell (“Battle of the Baltic”) and revived
again in Tennyson’s “Balaclava,” warrant me
in citing two stanzas of the original:&mdash;</p>

</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<h3>Ben Jonson.</h3>

<p>I now go back to that friend of Drayton’s&mdash;Ben
Jonson,<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> whom we saw at the closing of the
last chapter going into the tavern of the Mermaid.
He goes there, or to other like places, very often.
He is a friend no doubt of the landlady; he is a
friend, too, of all the housemaids, and talks university
chaff to them; a friend, too, of all such
male frequenters of the house as will listen to
him, and will never dispute him; otherwise he is
a slang-whanger and a bear.</p>

<p>He was born, as I have said, some years after
Shakespeare, but had roared himself into the front
ranks before the people of London were thoroughly
satisfied that the actor-author of “Richard III.” was
a better man than Ben. Very much of gossip with
respect to possible jealousies between Shakespeare
and Ben Jonson may be found in the clumsy,
bundled-up life of the latter by William Gifford.<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>

<p>Jonson was born probably in the west of London&mdash;and
born poor; but through the favor of
some friends went to Westminster School, near
to which his step-father, who was a bricklayer,
lived: afterward, through similar favor, he went
to Cambridge<a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>&mdash;not staying very long, because
called home to help that step-father at his bricklaying.
But he did stay long enough to get a thorough
taste for learning, and a thorough grounding
in it. So he fretted at the bricks, and ran off
and enlisted&mdash;serving a while in the Low Countries,
where poor Philip Sidney met his death,
and coming back, a swaggerer, apt with his sword
and his speech, into which he had grafted continentalisms;
apt at a quarrel, too, and comes to
fight a duel, and to kill his man.<a name="FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> For this he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
went to prison, getting material this way&mdash;by
hard rubs with the world&mdash;for the new work which
was ripening in the mind of this actor-author.
So, full of all experiences, full of Latin, full of
logic, full of history, full of quarrel, full of wine
(most whiles) this great, beefy man turned poet.
I do not know if you will read&mdash;do not think the
average reader of to-day will care to study&mdash;his
dramas. The stories of them are involved, but
nicely adjusted as the parts of an intricate machine:
you will grow tired, I dare say, of matching
part to part; tired of their involutions and evolutions;
tired of the puppets in them that keep
the machinery going; tired of the passion torn to
tatters; tired of the unrest and lack of all repose.
Yet there are abounding evidences of wit&mdash;of more
learning than in Shakespeare, and a great deal
drearier; aptnesses of expression, too, which show
a keen knowledge of word-meanings and of etymologies;
real and deep acquirement manifest, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
worn like stiff brocade, or jingling at his pace, like
bells upon the heels of a savage. You wonder to
find such occasional sense of music with such heavy
step&mdash;such delicate poise of such gross corporosity.</p>

<p>He helped some hack-writer to put Bacon’s essays
into Latin&mdash;not that Bacon did not know
his Latin; but the great chancellor had not
time for the graces of scholastics. Ben wrote
an English Grammar, too, which&mdash;for its syntax,
so far as one may judge from that compend
of it which alone remains&mdash;is as good as almost
any man could invent now. Such learning
weighed him down when he put on the buskins,
and made the stage tremble with his heaviness.
But when he was at play with letters&mdash;when
he had no plot to contrive and fabricate and
foster, and no character to file and finish, and
file again, and to fit in with precise order and
methodic juxtaposition&mdash;when a mad holiday
masque&mdash;wild as the “Pirates of Penzance”&mdash;tempted
him to break out into song, his verse is
rampant, joyous, exuberant&mdash;blithe and dewy as
the breath of May-day mornings: See how a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
damsel in the dance of his verse sways and pirouettes&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“As if the wind, not she did walk;</div>
<div class="verse">Nor pressed a flower, nor bowed a stalk!”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then, again, in an Epithalamion of his <cite>Underwoods</cite>,
as they were called, there is a fragment of
verse, which, in many of its delicious couplets, shows
the grace and art of Spenser’s wonderful “Epithalamion,”
which we read a little time ago:&mdash;He is
picturing the bridesmaids strewing the bride’s path
with flowers:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="verse indent1">And all the ground were garden, where she led.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Such verses do not come often into our newspaper
corners, from first hands: such verses make
one understand the significance of that inscription
which came by merest accident to be written on his
tomb in Westminster Abbey&mdash;“O rare Ben Jonson!”</p>

<p>In that line of work Shakespeare never did a
better thing than this. Indeed, in those days
many, perhaps most, people of learning and culture
thought Ben Jonson the better man of the two;&mdash;more
instructed (as he doubtless was); with a nicer
knowledge of the unities; a nicer knowledge of
mere conventionalities of all sorts: Shakespeare
was a humble, plain Warwickshire man, with no
fine tinsel to his wardrobe&mdash;had no university
training; not so much schooling or science of
any sort as Ben Jonson; had come up to London&mdash;as
would seem&mdash;to make his fortune, to
get money&mdash;to blaze his way: and how he did
it!</p>

<p>I suppose a Duchess of Buckingham or any
lady of court consequence would have been rather
proud of the obeisance of Ben Jonson, after that
play of “Every Man in his Humour,” and would
have given him a commendatory wave of her fan,
much sooner, and more unhesitatingly, than to the
Stratford actor, who took the part of Old Knowell
in it. Ben believed in conventional laws of speech
or of dramatic utterance far more than Shakespeare;
he regretted (or perhaps affected to regret when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
his jealousies were sleeping), that Will Shakespeare
did not shape his language and his methods with a
severer art;<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> he would&mdash;very likely&mdash;have lashed
him, if he had been under him at school, for his
irregularities of form and of speech&mdash;irregularities
that grew out of Shakespeare’s domination of the
language, and his will and his power to make it, in
all subtlest phases, the servant, and not the master
of his thought.</p>

<p>Do I seem, then, to be favoring the breakage of
customs, and of the rules of particular grammarians?
Yes, unhesitatingly&mdash;if you have the mastery
to do it as Shakespeare did it; that is, if you
have that finer sense of the forces and delicacies of
language which will enable you to wrest its periods
out of the ruts of every-day traffic, and set them to
sonorous roll over the open ground, which is broad
as humanity and limitless as thought. Parrots<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
must be taught to prate, particle by particle; but
the Bob-o-Lincoln swings himself into his great
flood of song as no master can teach him to sing.</p>

<p>Even now we do not bid final adieu to Ben Jonson;
but hope to encounter him again in the next
reign (that of James I.) through the whole of which
he carried his noisy literary mastership.</p>

<h3>Some Prose Writers.</h3>

<p>You must not believe, because I have kept mainly
by poetic writers in these later days of Queen
Elizabeth, that there were no men who wrote
prose&mdash;none who wrote travels, histories, letters
of advice; none who wrote stupid, dull, goodish
books; alas, there were plenty of them; there always
are.</p>

<p>But there were some to be remembered too:
there was William Camden&mdash;to whom I have
briefly alluded already&mdash;and of whom, when you
read good histories of this and preceding reigns,
you will find frequent mention. He was a learned
man, and a kind man, excellent antiquarian, and
taught Ben Jonson at Westminster School. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
was Stow,<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> who wrote a <cite>Survey of London</cite>, which he
knew from top to bottom. He was born in the
centre of it, and as a boy used to fetch milk from a
farm at the Minories, to his home in Cornhill, where
his father was a tailor. His fulness, his truthfulness,
his simplicities, and his quaintness have made
his chief book&mdash;on London&mdash;a much-prized one.</p>

<p>Again there was Hakluyt,<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> who was a church
official over in Bristol, and who compiled <cite>Voyages</cite>
of English seamen which are in every well-appointed
library. Dr. Robertson says in his <cite>History</cite>,
“England is more indebted [to Hakluyt] for
its American possessions than to any man of that
age.” Of so much worth is it to be a good geographer!
The “Hakluyt Society” of England will
be his enduring monument.</p>

<p>There was also living in those last days of the
sixteenth century a strange, conceited, curious travelling
man, Thomas Coryat<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> by name, who went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
on foot through Europe, and published (in 1611)
what he called&mdash;with rare and unwitting pertinence&mdash;<cite>Coryat’s
Crudities</cite>. He affixed to them
complimentary mention of himself&mdash;whimseys by
the poets, even by so great a man as Ben Jonson&mdash;a
budget of queer, half-flattering, half-ironical rigmarole,
which (having plenty of money) he had procured
to be written in his favor; and so ushered his
book into the world as something worth large notice.
He would have made a capital showman.
He had some training at Oxford, and won his way
by an inflexible persistence into familiarity with
men of rank, who made a butt of him. With a
certain gift for language he learned Arabic in some
one of his long journeyings, was said to have
knowledge of Persian, and made an oration in that
speech to the Great Mogul&mdash;with nothing but language
in it. His <cite>Crudities</cite> are rarely read; but
some letters and fragments relating to later travels
of his, appear in Purchas’ <cite>Pilgrims</cite>. He lays hold
upon peculiarities and littlenesses of life in his work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
which more sensible men would overlook, and
which give a certain quaint piquancy to what he
told; and we listen, as one might listen to barbers
or dressmakers who had just come back from Paris,
and would tell us things about cravats and hair-oil
and street sights that we could learn no otherwheres.
Coryat says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I observe a custom in all those Italian Cities, and tounes
thro’ the which I passed, that is not used in any other countrie
that I saw&mdash;nor do I think that any other nation of
Christendom doth use it, but only Italy. The Italian and
most other strangers that are <em>cormorant</em> in Italy doe always
at their meales use a little forke, when they cut their meate.
For while, with their knife which they hold in one hand
they cut the meate out of the dish, they fasten the forke
which they hold in their other hand upon the same dish, so
that whatsoever he be that sitting in the companie of any
others at meale, should unadvisidly touch the dish of meate
with his fingers from which alle at the table doe cut, he will
give occasion of offence unto the company, as having transgressed
the laws of good manners.</p>

<p>“This forme of feeding is, I understand, common in all
places of Italy&mdash;their forkes being for the most part made
of iron or steele, and some of silver&mdash;but <em>these</em> are used only
by gentlemen.</p>

<p>“I myself have thought good to imitate the Italy fashion
by this forked cutting of meate not only while I was in Italy,
but also in Germany, and oftentimes in England, since I
came home.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus we may connect the history of silver forks
with Tom Coryat’s <cite>Crudities</cite>, and with the first reported
foot-journeys of an Englishman over the
length and breadth of Europe. The wits may have
bantered him in Elizabeth’s day; but his journeyings
were opened and closed under James.</p>

<p>Again, there were books which had a little of
humor, and a little of sentiment, with a great deal
of fable, and much advice in them; as a sample of
which I may name Mr. Leonard Wright’s <cite>Displaie
of Duties, deck’t with sage Sayings, pythie Sentences,
and proper Similes: Pleasant to read, delightful to
hear, and profitable to practice</cite>:<a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> By which singularly
inviting title we perceive that he had caught
the euphuistic ways of Mr. John Lyly. In enumerating
the infelicities of a man who marries a
shrew, he says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Hee shall find compact in a little flesh a great number of
bones too hard to digest. And therefore some doe thinke
wedlocke to be that same purgatorie which some learned
divines have so long contended about, or a sharpe penance
to bring sinful men to Heaven. A merry fellow hearing a
preacher saye in his sermon that whosoever would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
saved must take up and beare his cross, ran straight to his
wife, and cast <em>her</em> upon his back.… Finally, he that
will live quietly in wedlock must be courteous in speech,
cheerful in countenance, provident for his house, careful to
traine up his children in virtue, and patient in bearing the
infirmities of his wife. Let all the keys hang at her girdle,
only the purse at his own. He must also be voide of jealousy,
which is a vanity to think, and more folly to suspect.
For eyther it needeth not, or booteth not, and to be jealous
without a cause is the next way to have a cause.</p>

<p>Quite another style of man was Philip Stubbes,<a name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>
a Puritan reformer&mdash;not to be confounded with
John Stubbes who had his right hand cut off, by
order of the Queen, for writing against the impropriety
and villainy of her prospective marriage with
a foreign prince&mdash;but a kinsman of his, who wrote
wrathily against masques and theatre-going; whipping
with his pen all those roystering poets who
made dramas or madrigals, all the fine-dressed
gallants, and all the fans and ruffs of the women as
so many weapons of Satan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“One arch or piller,” says he, “wherewith the Devil’s
kingdome of great ruffes is under propped, is a certain kind
of liquid matter which they call <em>starch</em>, wherein the Devil
hath learned them to wash and die their ruffes, which, being
drie, will stand stiff and inflexible about their neckes.”</p>

</div>

<p>And he tells a horrific story&mdash;as if it were true&mdash;about
an unfortunate wicked lady, who being invited
to a wedding could not get her ruff stiffened
and plaited as she wanted; so fell to swearing and
tearing, and vowed “that the Devil might have her
whenever she wore <em>neckerchers</em> again.” And the
Evil One took her at her word, appearing in the
guise of a presentable young man who arranged
her ruffs</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“&mdash;to her so great contentation and liking, that she became
enamored with him. The young man kissed her, in the
doing whereof he writhed her neck in sunder, so she died
miserably; her body being straightwaies changed into blue
and black colors, most ugglesome to behold, and her face
most deformed and fearful to look upon. This being
known in the city great preparation was made for her
burial, and a rich coffin was provided, and her fearful body
was laid therein. Four men assay’d to lift up the corps,
but could not move it. Whereat the standers-by&mdash;marvelling
causing the coffin to be opened to see the cause
thereof, found the body to be taken away, and a blacke
catte, very leane and deformed, sitting in the coffin, setting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
of great ruffes, and frizzling of haire, to the great feare
and wonder of all the beholders.”</p>

</div>

<p>We do not preach in just that way against fashionable
dressing in our time.</p>

<p>A book on the <cite>Arte of English Poesie</cite> belongs to
those days&mdash;supposed to be the work of George
Puttenham<a name="FNanchor_121" id="FNanchor_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>&mdash;written for the “recreation and
service” of the Queen; it has much good counsel
in it&mdash;specially in its latter part; and the author
says he wrote it to “help the gentlewomen of the
Court to write good Poetry.” As an exampler,
under his discussion of “Ornament,” he cites
what he graciously calls a “sweet and sententious
ditty” from the Queen’s own hand. The reader
will be curious perhaps to see some portion of
this:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“The doubt of future foes, exiles my present joy,</div>
<div class="verse">And wit me warnes to shun such snares as threaten mine annoy,</div>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span></p>

<p>This much will serve for our republican delectation;
but it is not the only instance in which
we find mention of her Majesty’s dalliance with
verse: In an old book called the <cite>Garden of the
Muses</cite>, of the date of 1600, the author says the
flowers are gathered out of many excellent speeches
spoken to her Majesty at triumphs, masques, and
shows, as also out of divers choice ditties sung to
her; and “some especially proceeding from her
own most sacred selfe.” No one of them, however,
would have ranked her with any of the poets of
whom we have made particular mention; but for
fine, clear, nervous, masculine English, to put into
a letter, or into a despatch, or into a closet scolding,
I suspect she would have held rank with any
of them.</p>

<p>If not a poet, she led poets into gracious ways
of speech. Her culture, her clear perceptions,
her love of pageants even, her intolerance of all
forms of dulness or slowness, her very vanities&mdash;were
all of them stimulants to those who could
put glowing thought into musical language. Her
high ruff, her jewelled corsage, her flashing eye,
her swift impulses, her perils, her triumphs, her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
audacities, her maidenhood&mdash;all drew flatteries
that heaped themselves in songs and sonnets. So
live a woman and so live a Queen magnetized dulness
into speech.</p>

<h3>The Queen’s Progresses.</h3>

<p>I spoke but now of her love of pageants; every
visiting prince from every great neighbor kingdom
was honored with a pageant; every foreign
suitor to her maidenly graces&mdash;whether looked
on with favor or disfavor (as to which her eye and
lip told no tales)&mdash;brought gala-days to London
streets&mdash;brought revels, and bear-baitings, and
high passages of arms, and swaying of pennons
and welcoming odes. Many and many a time the
roystering poets I named to you&mdash;the Greenes,
the Marlowes, the Jonsons, the Peeles, may have
looked out from the Mermaid Tavern windows
upon the royal processions that swept with gold-cloth,
and crimson housings through Cheapside,
where every house blazed with welcoming banners,
and every casement was crowded with the faces of
the onlookers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span></p>

<p>Thereby, too, she would very likely have passed
in her famous “Progresses” to her good friends in
the eastern counties; or to her loved Lord Burleigh,
or to Cecil, at their fine place of Theobalds’
Park,<a name="FNanchor_122" id="FNanchor_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> near Waltham Cross. True, old Burleigh
was wont to complain that her Majesty made him
frequent visits, and that every one cost him a matter
of two or three thousand pounds. Indeed it was
no small affair to take in the Queen with her attendants.
Hospitable people of our day are sometimes
taken aback by an easy-going friend who comes
suddenly on a visit with a wife, and four or five
children, and Saratoga trunks, and two or three
nursery-maids, and a few poodles and a fox-terrier;
but think of the Queen, with her tiring-women, and
her ladies of the chamber, and her ushers, and her
grand falconer, and her master of the hounds, and
her flesher&mdash;who knows the cuts she likes&mdash;and
her cook, and her secretary, and her fifty yeomen
of the guard, and her sumpter mules, and
her chaplain, and her laundry-women, and her fine-starchers!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
No wonder Lord Burleigh groaned
when he received a little notelet from his dear
Queen saying she was coming down upon him&mdash;for
a week or ten days.</p>

<p>And Elizabeth loved these little surprises overmuch,
and the progress along the high roads
thither and back, which so fed her vanities: She
was a woman of thrift withal, and loved her savings;
and the kitchen fires at Nonsuch palace, or
at Greenwich or at Richmond, might go out for a
time while she was away upon these junketings.</p>

<p>I know that my young readers will be snuggling
in their minds a memory of that greatest Progress
of hers, and that grandest of all private entertainments&mdash;at
Kenilworth Castle; wondering, maybe,
if that charming, yet over-sad story of Walter
Scott’s is true to the very life? And inasmuch as
they will be devouring that book, I suspect, a great
deal oftener than they will read Laneham’s account
of the great entertainment, or Gascoigne’s,<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> I will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
tell them how much, and where it varies from the
true record. There <em>was</em> a Robert Dudley, Earl of
Leicester&mdash;a brilliant man, elegant in speech, in
person, in manner&mdash;at a court where his nephew
Philip Sidney had shone&mdash;altogether such a courtier
as Scott has painted him: And the Queen had
regarded him tenderly&mdash;so tenderly that it became
the talk of her household and of the world. It is
certain, too, that Leicester gave to the Queen a
magnificent entertainment at his princely castle of
Kenilworth, in the month of July, 1575. There
were giants, there were Tritons, there were floating
islands. Lawns were turned into lakes, and lakes
were bridged with huge structures, roofed with
crimson canopies, where fairies greeted the great
guest with cornucopias of flowers and fruits.
There was fairy music too; there were dances and
plays and fireworks, that lighted all the region
round about with a blaze of burning darts, and
streams and hail of fire-sparks.</p>

<p>In all this there is no exaggeration in Scott’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
picturing; none either in his portraiture of the
coquetries and princely graces of the Queen. It is
probable that no juster and truer picture of her
aspect and bearing, and of the more salient points
of her character ever will or can be drawn.</p>

<p>Thither, too, had come&mdash;from all the country
round&mdash;yeomen, strolling players, adventurous
youths, quick to look admiringly after that brilliant
type of knighthood Sir Philip Sidney, then in his
twenty-first year, and showing his gay trappings
in the royal retinue: amongst such youths were,
very likely, Michael Drayton and William Shakespeare,
boys both in that day, just turned of eleven,
and making light of the ten or twelve miles of open
and beautiful country which lay between Kenilworth
and their homes of Atherstone and of Stratford-upon-Avon.</p>

<p>It is true too, that Leicester, so admired of the
Queen, and who was her host, had once married an
Amy Robsart: true, too, that this Amy Robsart had
died in a strangely sudden way at an old manor-house
of Cumnor; and true that a certain Foster
and Varney, who were dependants of Leicester, did
in some sense have her in their keeping. But&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
here the divergence from history begins&mdash;this
poor Amy Robsart had been married to Sir
Robert Dudley before he came to the title of Leicester,
and she died in the mysterious way alluded
to, some fifteen years before these revels of Kenilworth:
but not before Elizabeth had been attracted
by the proud and noble bearing of Robert Dudley.
Her fondness for him began about the year 1559.
And it was this early fondness of hers which gave
color to the story that he had secretly caused the
death of Amy Robsart. The real truth will probably
never be known: there was a public inquiry (not so
full, he said, as he could have wished) which acquitted
Leicester; but his character was such that
he never outlived suspicion. I observe that Mr.
Motley, in his <cite>History of the United Netherlands</cite>,
on the faith of a paper in the Record Office, avers
Leicester’s innocence; but the tenor of a life counts
for more than one justifying document in measuring
a man’s moral make-up.</p>

<p>In the year 1575, when the revels of Kenilworth
occurred, the Earl of Leicester was a widower and
Amy Robsart had been ten years mouldering in her
grave: but in the year 1576 the young Countess of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
Essex suddenly became a widow, and was married
privately, very shortly afterward, to the Earl of
Leicester. In the next year, 1577, the story was
blazed abroad, and the Queen showed her appreciation
of the sudden match by sending Leicester
straight to the Tower. But she forgave him presently.
And out of these scattered actualities, as
regards the Earl, Sir Walter Scott has embroidered
his delightful romance.</p>

<p>But we have already brought our literary mention
up to a point far beyond this in the Queen’s
life; up to a point where Shakespeare, instead of
tearing over hedge-rows and meadows to see the
Tritons and the harlequins of Kenilworth, has put
his own Tritons to swimming in limpid verse, and
has put his bloated, dying Falstaff to “babbling
o’ green fields.” The Queen, too, who has
listened&mdash;besides these revels&mdash;to the tender
music of Spenser and outlived him; who has heard
the gracious courtliness of Sidney, and outlived
him; who has lent a willing ear to the young flatteries
of Raleigh and seen him ripen into a gray-haired
adventurer of the seas; who has watched the
future Lord Keeper, Francis Bacon, as he has shot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
up from boyhood into the stateliness of middle
age; who has seen the worshipful Master John
Lyly grow up, and chant his euphuism and sing
his songs and die: she too, now, is feeling the
years&mdash;brilliant as they may be in achievement&mdash;count
and weigh upon her.</p>

<p>Long as she could, she cherished all the illusions
of youth. That poor old face of hers was, I suspect,
whited and reddened with other pigments
than what the blood made, as the years went by.
Such out-of-door sports as bear-baiting became
rarer and rarer with her; and she loved better
such fun as the fat Falstaff made, in her theatre
of Whitehall. But only nicest observers saw the
change; and she never admitted it&mdash;perhaps not
to herself.</p>

<p>The gossiping Paul Hentzner, who had an ambassador’s
chances of observation, says of her, on
her way to chapel at Greenwich:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Next came the Queen, in her sixty-fifth year, as we are
told&mdash;very majestic: her face, oblong, fair but wrinkled;
her eyes small, yet black and pleasant; her nose a little
hooked. She had in her ears two pearls with very rich
drops; and she had on a necklace of exceeding fine jewels.
She was dressed in white silk bordered with pearls of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
the size of beans, and over it a mantle of black silk shot
with silver threads.”</p>

</div>

<p>This, observe, was over twenty years after the
revels of Kenilworth: and two years beyond this
date, when the Queen was sixty-seven, a courtier
writes: “Her Majesty is well, and every second
day is on horseback.” No suitor could say a pleasanter
thing to her than&mdash;“Your majesty is looking
very young!” She danced, when it made her old
bones ache to dance.</p>

<p>No suitor could say a more inapt thing than to
express a fear that a revel, or a play, or a hunt,
or a dance might possibly fatigue her Majesty. It
would bring a warning shake of the head that
made the jewels rattle.</p>

<p>But at last the days come&mdash;as like days are coming
to us all&mdash;when she can counterfeit youth no
longer. The plays entice her no more. The three
thousand court dresses that she left, hang unused
in her wardrobe: weaknesses hem her in, turn
which way she may. Cecil, the son of her old favorite
Burleigh, urges that she must quit her chair&mdash;which
she clung to, propped with pillows&mdash;that
she <em>must</em> take to her bed. “<em>Must</em>,” she cries, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
a kindling of her old passionate life, “little man,
little man, thy father never dared to use such a
word to his Queen.” The gust passes; and she
clings to life, as all do, who have such fast, hard
grip upon it. In short periods of languor and repose,
taking kindly to the issue&mdash;going out, as it
were, like a lamp. Then, by some windy burst of
passion&mdash;of hate, flaming up red and white and
hot&mdash;her voice a scream, her boding of the end a
craze, her tenacity of purpose dragging all friends,
all hopes, all the world to the terrible edge where
she stands&mdash;the edge where Essex stood (she bethinks
herself with a wild tempest of tears)&mdash;the
edge where Marie Stuart stood at Fotheringay, in
her comely widow’s dress; thinks of this with a
shrug that means acquiescence, that means stubborn
recognition of a fatal duty: <em>that</em> ghost does
no way disturb her.</p>

<p>But there are others which well may. Shall we
tell them over?</p>

<p>No; let us leave her with her confessor, saying
prayers maybe; her rings on her fingers; the lace
upon her pillow; not forgetting certain fine coquetries
to the last: strong-souled, keen-thoughted, ambitious,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
proud, vindictive, passionate woman, with
her streaks of tenderness out of which bitter tears
flowed&mdash;out of which kindlinesses crept to sun
themselves, but were quick overshadowed by her
pride.</p>

<p>Farewell to her!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In our next talk we shall meet a King&mdash;but a
King who is less a man than this Queen who is
dead.</p>

Priors also had presidence over some religious houses&mdash;but
theirs was usually a delegated authority. An æsthetic abbot
or prior was always building&mdash;or always getting new colors
for the <em>missal</em> work in the <em>scriptorium</em>: hunting abbots were
thinking more of the refectory. At least six religious services
were held a day, and always midnight mass. It was
easy, but not wholly a life of idleness. A bell summoned to
breakfast, and bells to mass. Of a sunny day&mdash;monks were
teaching boys one side of the cloister&mdash;artistic monks working
at their missals the other; perhaps under such prior as

of age which crept into some of the latter verse of the

An earlier English version (1550) was, in effect, only a translation
of a translation, being based upon the French of
Claude de Seyssel, Bishop of Marseilles. Hobbes sneers at
this, and certainly made a better one&mdash;very literal, sometimes

own (for we can hardly hope for absolute certainty)
should consult the recent scholarly edition, edited by A. H.
Bullen (Nimmo, 1884), in three volumes. We doubt, however,
if such popular re-establishment of the poet’s fame

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.</p>

<p>Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE<br />
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</h2>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

<h3 class="pg">Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
